AAPB,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

AAPB,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

AAPB,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

AAPB,2024-10-02,How investors can get in on the China stock rally with ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-china-stock-rally-etfs-172514354.html,"China stocks (^HSI) have extended their rally after the People's Bank of China unveiled new stimulus measures in an effort to recover its struggling economy.
Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

AAPB,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

AAPB,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

AAPB,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

AAPB,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

AAPB,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

AAPB,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In a lower interest rate environment, Powers focuses on traditional defensive sectors like utilities (XLU), consumer staples XLP (XLP), and financials XLF (XLF), noting that “we still expect some short-term volatility as we enter October, which is historically the most volatile month of the year in election years.”

Meanwhile, Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist, breaks down the pros and cons between buying now and waiting. ""Now we're at that seasonal slowdown sweet spot for buyers. So there's less competition which can make it easier to snag a deal on a home. At the same time, you might see lower rates if you wait into the spring. But you might have to offset those lower rates with more competition and better prices. You know, in essence, I don't think buyers can go wrong either way,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

AAPB,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

AAPB,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

AAPB,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

AAPB,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

AMDL,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

AMDL,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

AMDL,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

AMDL,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

AMDL,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

AMDL,2024-09-30,"Labor market in focus, port strike looms ahead: Morning Brief",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/labor-market-focus-port-strike-165636574.html,"On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills analyze the market open and discuss some of the biggest stories of the trading day.
All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

AMDL,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

AMDL,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

AMDL,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

AMDL,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window.

AMDL,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

AMDL,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

AMDL,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

AMDL,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

CLOU,2024-05-10,ETF Spotlight: EBIZ Regains Momentum After Brief Dip,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etf-spotlight-ebiz-regains-momentum-173000824.html,"Global X E-commerce ETF (EBIZ) shares climbed more than a percentage point on Thursday, returning to its months-long perch in positive territory.
The e-commerce-focused fund has soared about 40% over the past year to trade above $24, a result of robust consumer spending that has been driving U.S. post-Covid economic growth and sent stocks in the sector higher. It has risen more than 20% this year.
EBIZ had dipped the previous day along with other major e-commerce companies— First Trust Dow Jones International Internet ETF (FDNI), the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU), and ProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN)—after e-commerce software developer Shopify Inc. reported disappointing guidance for its second quarter and the company's share price plunged more than 20%.
FDNI, CLOU and ONLN were back in the green on Thursday. They have benefited from steady gains from online retail and related stocks that are their primary holdings and that have been swept upward by surprisingly robust U.S. consumer spending, particularly online. ONLN is up more than 35% during the past year.

U.S. e-commerce sales in 2023 rose by 7.6%, outpacing the 2.1% gain for retail sales broadly, according to the Census Bureau. Globally, e-commerce sales grew a faster 10% and are expected to grow another 9% this year.
EBIZ's Global Portfolio
EBIZ, which started trading in November 2018 and has about $76 million in assets under management, has targeted the growing importance of e-commerce by tracking online retailers, marketplace platforms, and supporting businesses—such as software providers—that generate at least 50% of their revenues from e-commerce-related operations.
About two-thirds of its portfolio are U.S.-based companies, but the fund has a global footprint. Its second largest holding—more than 4%—is the Singapore-based conglomerate Sea Limited. Tempe, Ariz.-based Carvana Co., the largest holding, also makes up more than 4% of EBIZ's holdings, as do retail giants Amazon.com Inc. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. and Ottawa-based Shopify.
According to Shopify’s Global Ecommerce Sales Growth Report, online sales are expected to “continue rising and take a larger piece of the retail pie.” 
 
“In 2025, global ecommerce sales are forecast to rise to $6.86 trillion, before adding another $550 billion in 2026, to $7.41 trillion. By 2027, it’s estimated that world retail ecommerce sales will hit $7.96 trillion,” according to the report.

CLOU,2024-05-08,Online Retail ETFs Plunge After Shopify Earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/online-retail-etfs-plunge-shopify-230154640.html,"E-commerce exchange-traded funds tumbled on Wednesday as shares of Shopify plunged by nearly 20%.
The developer of software for running online stores said that its expenses will rise in the second quarter, while its revenue growth will decelerate.
Ottawa-based Shopify has a market capitalization of $80 billion, making it one of the world’s largest e-commerce companies.
The stock has substantial weightings in funds like the First Trust Dow Jones International Internet ETF (FDNI), the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU), and the Global X E-Commerce ETF (EBIZ).
Shopify reported healthy earnings for the first quarter. Merchants using the company’s platform sold $60.9 billion worth of goods and services, generating $1.9 billion of revenues for Shopify. Both figures were up 23% from a year ago.
However, Shopify said that its second quarter revenue growth rate would slow to “a high-teens percentage rate,” disappointing investors.
The firm also forecast that operating expenses in second quarter would rise by a “low-to-mid-single digit percentage rate compared to Q1 2024.” 
 
Analysts at Baird said that Shopify’s higher operating expense guidance overshadows “an otherwise solid report.” 
 
They said that the company is “probably leaning into marketing and R&D (AI/GenAI) investments,” but “without a clear positive impact on [gross merchandise value] and revenues from recent investments, investors will question the margin trajectory.”
E-Commerce Soars
Shopify’s drop on Wednesday was a black eye for the e-commerce industry, but it did little to dent the strong performance for e-commerce stocks as a whole this year.
EBIZ is still up 13.1% year-to-date, while the ProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN) is up by 12.3%.
U.S. e-commerce sales in 2023 rose by 7.6%, outpacing the 2.1% gain for retail sales broadly, according to the Census Bureau.
Globally, e-commerce sales grew a faster 10% and are expected to grow another 9% this year.
According to Shopify’s Global Ecommerce Sales Growth Report, online sales are expected to “continue rising and take a larger piece of the retail pie.”

CLOU,2024-02-13,Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU) Hits New 52-Week High,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloud-computing-etf-clou-hits-193400204.html,"For investors seeking momentum, GX Cloud Computing ETF CLOU is probably on the radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up 47.94% from its 52-week low price of $16/share.
But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed:
CLOU in Focus
The underlying Indxx Global Cloud Computing Index provides exposure to exchange-listed companies in developed and emerging markets that are positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of cloud computing technology. The product charges 68 bps in annual fees (See: All Technology ETFs).
Why the Move?
The cloud computing corner of the broad stock market has been an area to watch lately, given rising demand. Cloud computing has been an important catalyst in technological advancement, offering efficient solutions to consumers and enterprises alike. Advancements in cloud tech like AI and cybersecurity have broadened cloud service applications, drawing in a wider customer demographic. Additionally, growing investments in cloud infrastructure have played a pivotal role in driving growth.
More Gains Ahead?
Currently, CLOU has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and might continue its strong performance in the near term, with a positive weighted alpha of 34.21, which gives cues of a further rally.

DFEN,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

DFEN,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

DFEN,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

DFEN,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

DFEN,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

yesterday
As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

DFEN,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

DFEN,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

DFEN,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

DFEN,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs.

If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

DFEN,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

DFEN,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

DFEN,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

DFEN,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

DPST,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

DPST,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

DPST,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

DPST,2024-10-02,How investors can get in on the China stock rally with ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-china-stock-rally-etfs-172514354.html,"China stocks (^HSI) have extended their rally after the People's Bank of China unveiled new stimulus measures in an effort to recover its struggling economy.
Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

DPST,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

DPST,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

DPST,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

DPST,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

DPST,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

DPST,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

Matt Powers, Powers Advisory Group managing partner, discusses how to best position your portfolio in a rate-easing cycle and an election year. In a lower interest rate environment, Powers focuses on traditional defensive sectors like utilities (XLU), consumer staples XLP (XLP), and financials XLF (XLF), noting that “we still expect some short-term volatility as we enter October, which is historically the most volatile month of the year in election years.”
As mortgage rates hit a two-year low, Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero breaks down what it means for potential homebuyers as they navigate the housing market. Meanwhile, Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist, breaks down the pros and cons between buying now and waiting. ""Now we're at that seasonal slowdown sweet spot for buyers. So there's less competition which can make it easier to snag a deal on a home. At the same time, you might see lower rates if you wait into the spring. But you might have to offset those lower rates with more competition and better prices. You know, in essence, I don't think buyers can go wrong either way,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

DPST,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

DPST,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

DPST,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

DPST,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

NEW YORK, July 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck is today celebrating the fact that its VanEck Merk Gold Trust (OUNZ) recently surpassed $1B in assets under management (AUM).
OUNZ, which launched in May of 2014, has for the last decade provided investors with the means to not only add gold exposure to their portfolios but also to take physical delivery of their gold holdings. Underpinning OUNZ is a proprietary process developed by its sponsor, Merk Investments LLC, through which investors are able to request and then take possession of gold coins and bars in the denominations they desire. Investors taking delivery of their physical gold via OUNZ do not encounter a taxable event, as they are merely taking possession of what they already own: the gold.
""While the price of gold has been increasing in 2024, few gold-focused exchange-traded products have seen inflows. OUNZ has actually been seeing relatively consistent inflows for the last several years, a testament to the unique features of the offering,"" said Ed Lopez, Head of Product Management with VanEck. ""VanEck traces its history in gold investing back more than 50 years, and we’ve long prided ourselves on delivering innovative ways for investors to add the yellow metal to their portfolios. This is a significant milestone that we’re pleased to celebrate.""
VanEck has been at the forefront of gold investing since the firm’s inception. The firm offers both actively and passively managed investment solutions, including the US’s first gold stock fund, VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX), launched in 1968; the first gold miners ETF, VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX); and the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ).
""We join our partners at VanEck in celebrating this milestone for OUNZ,"" added Axel Merk, President and Chief Investment Officer with Merk Investments. ""Gold’s role in times of uncertainty, like those through which we have been living and investing the past several years, is well known. But we’re pleased to note that OUNZ’s unique approach and the means through which we can provide investors with access to physical gold is becoming just as well known and accepted.""

About VanEck
VanEck has a history of looking beyond the financial markets to identify trends that are likely to create impactful investment opportunities. We were one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international markets. This set the tone for the firm’s drive to identify asset classes and trends – including gold investing in 1968, emerging markets in 1993, and exchange traded funds in 2006 – that subsequently shaped the investment management industry.

NEW YORK, April 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck is today celebrating that CEO Jan van Eck was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 ETF.com Awards.
In 2006, van Eck boldly led the firm’s entry into the ETF space with the launch of the now $14 billion VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), and the firm recently surpassed $100 billion in AUM. He has fostered a commitment to product innovation centered around the firm’s core investment philosophy that financial markets are a reflection of a broader world that encompasses economic, political, technological and social dynamics. This is evident in the firm’s ETFs, which include the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT) and ""moat""-focused fund suite, the VanEck Fallen Angel High Yield Bond ETF (ANGL), and more.
""I am honored by this recognition. It is a reflection of the strong team here at VanEck as well as our partnerships across the industry, from index firms and liquidity providers to stock exchanges,"" said van Eck. ""One of the biggest lessons from my career is simply: don’t give up. I had tried different things over my career and was in my 40s when the firm started in ETFs, so from my own experience, I know that success sometimes takes time.""
This tenacity, dedication to product development and van Eck’s long-standing belief in the transformative potential of bitcoin is evident in the firm’s digital assets efforts, where it was the first established ETF issuer to file for a bitcoin-linked ETF in 2017.
The ETF.com Awards serve to recognize and honor exceptional achievements within the ETF space, particularly those remarkable individuals, companies and products that have left an indelible mark on the ETF ecosystem. Held each year in New York City, the award ceremony is attended by hundreds of professionals in the space and is closely followed by investors, advisors and financial industry professionals around the world.

GDX,2024-04-09,Gold's Rise Taunts Advisors Who've Seen This Before,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/golds-rise-taunts-advisors-whove-120000795.html,"Better late than never.
That might describe the recent breakout for the price of gold in U.S dollar terms. After several flirtatious attempts going back more than a decade, it finally crossed $2,000 an ounce and stayed there for longer than a fortnight.
Gold pierced that round number mark back in August of 2020, only to disappoint those expecting it to skyrocket higher. And way back in September of 2011, gold peaked at more than $1,900 an ounce. At the time, it seemed destined to go up much more, or so the headlines at the time claimed.
Gold, with limited industrial applications but centuries of symbolism and use as an actual currency, has its army of perma-bulls. Still, for a long time, advances in the metal's prices have been slapped back like a rejected basketball shot.
Now, with a closing price last Friday above $2,300 an ounce, and up more than 25% since last October, gold fans are feeling it again. And who can blame them. Inflation may be re-accelerating, the U.S. Dollar is backing a $34 trillion pile of debt, and market technicians can make a case for much higher prices, now that the long-term “breakout” has finally occurred.
Gold ETFs Ups and Downs
Parabolic moves like the one gold just had might be a double-edged sword. Holders of the two dominant asset-gatherers in the gold commodity space, the $61 billion SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and the $28 billion iShares Gold Trust (IAU) have seen those ETFs move like a roller coaster in recent years. They've doubled since early 2016.
Financial advisors have watched clients get excited about big moves in tech stocks and small caps, a giant bond market rebound, and bitcoin. And that’s just in recent memory. Yet all of those moves have, or are hinting at, what I refer to as the “Empire State Building” chart formation. That is, a sudden spike higher, that soon reverses in large part or in total. Picture the top of New York’s Empire State Building, which narrows at the top, then ends with a long needle at the peak. But that needle has two sides. Will the gold chart resemble that in a few months?
Gold is a most intriguing ETF asset class, since it can be owned via funds that track the price of gold, the commodity. However, gold mining stock ETFs allow advisors to allocate to a version of the gold trade that has revenue, earnings, people, and operations behind it. That all just happens to involve the business of mining that yellow metal.
Gold Mining Stock ETFs
Funds like the $14.2 billion Van Eck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) and the $114 million Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM) are among the 14 gold mining ETFs tracked by the etf.com database. And unlike gold itself, they are still quite a distance from making all-time highs. They are part of the basic material sector, which is a small portion of the S&P 500 that hasn't kept up with market leaders in tech and elsewhere. That could set up an opportunity for advisors to increase allocations to a relatively out of favor industry that can potentially follow its underlying commodity price higher.

(TSX: CXB; OTCQX: CXBMF) (the ""Company"" or ""Calibre"") is pleased to announce the operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (all financial amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated). 
Darren Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Calibre, stated: “Consistent with H1 2024 production expectations the team delivered 61,767 ounces in Q1, with gold production H2 weighted as additional organic production sources and higher-grade zones of gold mineralization are brought into the mine plan. We remain on track to deliver full year 2024 production guidance of 275,000 – 300,000 ounces.
The beginning of 2024 has proven to be exciting for Calibre with the close of the acquisition of the multi-million-ounce Valentine Gold Mine (“VGM”) in Canada, a fourth consecutive year of Mineral Reserve growth and our inclusion into the Van Eck GDX Index. Since becoming a gold producer during Q4, 2019, Calibre has delivered annual production growth of 28% year on year, with a track record of meeting or beating expectations. We are on a clear and concise path of delivery and growth. With an investment of more than 130,000 metres of resource expansion and discovery drilling in 2024, I am excited to see continued positive results across our entire portfolio of assets.
2024 and 2025 will be transformational years, driven by an increase in gold production and significant exploration across the Americas. I am pleased to report the final phases of construction and operational readiness remain on track and fully funded at VGM in preparation for first gold production in H1, 2025 to unlock significant production growth and value for our shareholders.
During this time of significant growth, Calibre remains committed to its pursuit of excellence in sustainability and ethical mining practices. Our efforts extend beyond regulatory compliance, focusing on continuous improvement to minimize our environmental footprint, as well as transparent and extensive community engagement to create a positive impact in the regions in which we operate.”
Q1 2024 Highlights
Completed the acquisition of Marathon Gold, securing significant future growth as construction of the multi-million-ounce Valentine Gold Mine surpasses 61% complete;
Consolidated quarterly gold production of 61,767 ounces:
Nicaragua gold production of 55,007 ounces and Nevada gold production of 6,760 ounces;

Notes:
(1) NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company believes that investors use certain non-IFRS measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies, specifically Total Cash Costs per Ounce and All-In Sustaining Costs per Ounce. In the gold mining industry, these are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Total Cash Costs per Ounce of Gold: Total cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, and local administrative costs (including stock-based compensation related to mine operations), royalties, production taxes, mine standby costs and current inventory write downs, if any. Production costs are exclusive of depreciation and depletion, reclamation, capital, and exploration costs. Total cash costs per gold ounce are net of by-product silver sales and are divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.
All-In Sustaining Costs per Ounce of Gold: A performance measure that reflects all of the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from current operations. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company’s definition is derived from the AISC definition as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance dated June 27, 2013 and November 16, 2018. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory, non-profit organization established in 1987 whose members include global senior mining companies. The Company believes that this measure will be useful to external users in assessing operating performance and the ability to generate free cash flow from current operations. The Company defines AISC as the sum of total cash costs (per above), sustaining capital (capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels), capital lease repayments, corporate general and administrative expenses, exploration expenditures designed to increase resource confidence at producing mines, amortization of asset retirement costs and rehabilitation accretion related to current operations. AISC excludes capital expenditures for significant improvements at existing operations deemed to be expansionary in nature, exploration and evaluation related to resource growth, rehabilitation accretion and amortization not related to current operations, financing costs, debt repayments, and taxes. Total all-in sustaining costs are divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.

GDX,2024-04-01,Gold Mining Stocks Are Stupid Cheap as Gold Prices Hit Record Highs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-mining-stocks-stupid-cheap-183813124.html,"Are you considering investing in gold mining stocks as the price of gold rallies? There are several reasons why now might be a good time. First and foremost, they can provide a quasi-form of leveraged exposure to gold prices. If the price of gold rises, gold mining stocks may rise even more.
But that’s not the only reason. Many gold mining stocks offer dividends, providing a source of income in addition to potential capital appreciation. Investing in gold mining stocks can provide diversification benefits, as they often have a low correlation with other assets, such as stocks and bonds.
The valuations on gold mining stocks are stupid cheap.
Why Gold Mining Stocks Are Heating Up
I think a large part of the move in gold is due to its safe-haven status during times of geopolitical uncertainty, which can lead to increased demand for gold and gold mining stocks. If gold is indeed sending a warning, then mining stocks stand to benefit,  particularly since investors have largely ignored them in this AI-fueled market.
The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) offers quick, broad-based exposure to the gold mining industry without the need to pick individual stocks. This ETF focuses on established gold and silver mining companies with stable cash flows, making it suitable for the core of a gold allocation.
Just keep in mind that gold mining stocks are inherently volatile. As gold prices rise or fall, the profitability of mining companies is directly impacted, leading to corresponding movements in their stock prices.
Investors must also consider the operational risks associated with mining companies, such as higher production costs, which can erode profitability and lead to lower stock prices. Changes in government policies, regulations, and taxation in the countries where mining operations are located can also significantly impact the performance of gold mining stocks. None of this may matter in the here and now, but it is worth keeping in the back of your mind if you’re looking to make a longer-term allocation.
The Bottom Line
I like the space here. The only real complicating factor however is oil. Because mining operations are very energy intensive, surging oil prices can negate the impact of surging gold prices. The ideal scenario would be oil falling while gold continues to run. I think this is a distinct possibility.
Some would argue it’s better to just go direct and access gold itself rather than play with the stock side. I don’t disagree this is cleaner. But gold mining stocks are cheap, unloved, and have done nothing for some time. There’s an opportunity for momentum here, and I think it’s a good time to consider positioning as investors finally come around to my thesis that there is the potential for a reverse carry trade dynamic from Japan.

Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.
Video Transcript
- Let's get over to Jared Blikre for a closer look at some of the gains that we're seeing at the open, Jared.
JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Stocks are indeed ripping. We can see this across the board here. Small caps actually up the most, up nearly 1%. Dow is in the rear but it's still holding onto gains of about 54 basis points. I want to talk about gold right now then I'll get into some stock action. This is gold futures over the last month, and we are sitting on the sixth day of gains here. You can see we've really launched higher, pretty strong move.
And if you take a look at the prices that we've been at historically, and here's a better chart for you to gauge, you can see all this sideways action. And in fact, on a five-year chart you're going to see it goes back even farther. So when you have a long consolidation period, you tend to, and you get a breakout, you tend to go for extended periods after that as well. So it's all about momentum.
Now, here's the gold volatility index. Yes, there is a VIX of the gold. You can see rather low levels right now. But interestingly, gold tends to rise with volatility. So we actually want to see this move up and to support the move. And then finally, I want to check out with respect to gold, the miners, because they are lagging here. Gold is up here, miners down here. They got a game of catch up to do, which they usually do once the futures get going, so we'll have to see if that happens.
And then rounding out the precious precious metals, here's silver over five years. It is still stuck in its range. So it could very well break out, and it will eventually, but just not the time yet. Now, checking inside the market, interesting sector action. We have materials up the most. That's up 1% followed by tech, industrials, communication services, and utilities. So looking like a pretty healthy mix.
And for everybody worried about those mega-caps, even Apple, all of them up today. Broadcom, J was just talking about them, up 2%, looking forward to those earnings after the bell. Now bigger than Tesla, and there's Nvidia, another record high, up 2%. Guys.
- Keeps climbing to the upside. All right, Jared. Thanks so much for breaking that down for us.

GPIQ,2024-07-16,GPIQ: Goldman’s Monthly Dividend ETF with a Double-Digit Yield,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gpiq-goldman-monthly-dividend-etf-035242465.html,"Dividend ETFs that sell call options to generate high yields and monthly payouts have become popular, and blue-chip asset manager Goldman Sachs (GS) has its own entrant into the space with its new Goldman Sachs Nasdaq 100 Core Premium Income ETF (GPIQ).
I’m bullish on this new entrant into the space based on its sizable, double-digit distribution yield (explained in detail below), appealing monthly payout schedule, and diversified portfolio of highly-rated large-cap technology stocks.
What Is the GPIQ ETF’s Strategy?
According to Goldman Sachs, GPIQ “seeks current income while maintaining prospects for capital appreciation.”
Like other popular monthly dividend ETFs, Goldman Sachs explains that GPIQ “aims to generate a consistent monthly distribution rate generally from options premium and equity dividends.”
GPIQ invests in the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 and generates a steady stream of monthly income for its holders through dividends from its holdings and income received for selling covered calls against these holdings. Goldman states that GPIQ will typically sell calls in an amount ranging between 25% and 75% of the value of the fund’s equity portfolio. The fund also has the ability to invest in and sell calls on other ETFs and over-the-counter (OTC) instruments.
How Does GPIQ Generate Income?
Let’s take a closer look at how this strategy works in practice. GPIQ sells covered calls on the stocks it holds and uses the income it receives from selling these call contracts to distribute income to its holders on a monthly basis. This is an effective strategy for generating a sizable amount of income.
The inherent tradeoff that investors need to be aware of here is that GPIQ likely sacrifices a degree of potential upside from capital appreciation. When its holdings rise above the strike price for the calls it is selling, it doesn’t participate in any of the gains above this strike price because it is obligated to sell its shares at the contracted price.
As Goldman itself explains in the fund’s summary prospectus, “In rising markets where the aggregate
appreciation of the underlying index over its exercise price exceeds the income from premiums, a portfolio with a call writing strategy could underperform the same portfolio without the options.”
Let’s look at an example using GPIQ’s top holding, Apple (AAPL). GPIQ hypothetically sells Apple calls set to expire in a month with a strike price of $250. The fund theoretically receives a premium of $500 from the buyer of the options for selling these calls. However, if the shares of Apple settle at $275 on the closing date, GPIQ is contractually obligated to sell these shares to the buyer of the call for the contracted price of $250, meaning that it isn’t entitled to any of the gains above $250.

IWM,2024-10-03,Why Gen Z bets big while boomers play it safe: A generational breakdown of market returns,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gen-z-bets-big-while-boomers-play-it-safe-a-generational-breakdown-of-market-returns-163139081.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
It's a Goldilocks moment for investors.
As the books are closed on September, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has delivered a solid 20% return so far this year. Meanwhile, bonds are up a respectable 4.7%. And cash is yielding a similar percentage return — even after the Fed began cutting rates a few weeks ago.
But new research from Jack Manley at JPMorgan Asset Management uncovers hidden pitfalls, particularly for those entering their investment years during periods of high cash yields (much like the present). His findings suggest that all investors, regardless of generation, are heavily shaped by the market environment they grew up in.
Manley's methodology, rooted in demographic and behavioral analysis, assumes individuals begin investing 20 years after their generation's inception. For example, baby boomers started investing around 1966, Gen X in 1985, millennials in 2001, and Gen Z in 2017.
Source: FactSet, Robert Shiller, JPMorgan Asset Management. *Investment periods begin 20 years after each generation's inception based on the assumption that people have access to investable capital at this age. Investment periods begin in the following years: Baby Boomer (1966), Generation X (1985), Millennials (2001), Generation Z (2017). Annualized total returns are calculated using monthly data as of March 31, 2024. Data are as of June 30, 2024.
Over the decades, boomers have weathered all sorts of market turmoil, from the inflation crises of the 1970s to multiple tech booms later in life. With average annual stock returns around 10.2% and bond returns of 6.2%, their experience reflects a period of high growth and volatility.
As Manley explained in an episode of Stocks in Translation, “the Fed paid pathological attention” to the inflation crisis, and the entire experience had a profound effect in shaping boomers' cautious and diversified approach to investing — despite the strong returns.
For Generation X, the journey has been one of boom-bust cycles. But the older cohort of this group largely began investing amid a secular boom in markets. Entering adulthood during the 1980s, they witnessed the rise of tech but also faced brutal recessions, from the dot-com bubble to the 2008 financial crisis.
With returns hovering around 11.6% for stocks, their approach is cautious but optimistic. As Manley noted about the current market environment, “strong balance sheets are very important right now.” This may resonate with Gen X’s preference for financial resilience in uncertain times.
Millennials are the most educated generation, as measured by the percentage with bachelor's degrees or higher. But they have not fared as well in stock market returns, averaging around 8.0%, according to Manley.
When millennials came of investing age in 2001, the S&P 500 peaked, ushering in the dot-com bust. After stocks roared back amid a housing boom, the global financial crisis created a double top in the benchmark in 2007 that would not be eclipsed until 2013 — leaving millennial investors underwater for a dozen years.

IWM,2024-10-01,Here's how AI is set to disrupt healthcare — albeit slowly,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
The third quarter just wrapped, and the pure AI trade of Nvidia (NVDA) and its chip cohorts suddenly finds itself a net drag on overall S&P 500 performance — which itself surprised investors with a solid 5.5% return.
Nevertheless, generative AI is still hot and slowly moving into real-world applications.
Abby Yoder, US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, highlighted that healthcare, which is notoriously slow-moving, may be an upcoming candidate for AI-driven innovation.
""Healthcare has underperformed seven of the last eight years,"" Yoder pointed out in a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, despite the sector being the only one in the S&P 500 to boast positive annual earnings growth over the past 21 years.
But Yoder sees AI as a potential key to unlock a long-awaited shake-up that could bring long-term growth back to the sector.
Healthcare stocks have struggled in recent years, a trend Yoder attributes to legacy constraints of old systems and obstacles that make it difficult for new technologies to take root. The byzantine web of players, rules, regulators, and more has so far prevented significant AI adoption, which has the potential to address inefficiencies in insurance approvals, manual record-keeping, and claims management, all of which drag on productivity.

There are some ripples of change, however. Companies like Google and Microsoft are diving into this space, partnering with hospitals and startups to create AI tools that lighten this burden.
On the diagnostic side, AI is being used to streamline medical imaging, cutting down time for tasks like identifying patterns in medical data, which improves both speed and accuracy in patient care. The goal is not to rid the world of human radiologists and technicians, but empower them with 21st-century tools that lighten their load and accelerate patient diagnoses and recoveries.
AI proponents say it's not just about cutting costs; it’s about revolutionizing patient care. By using vast datasets of clinical information, the promise of AI is to someday help predict patient outcomes more effectively, modeling care before it happens to anticipate complications and select treatments.
The other great hope for medical AI bulls is the immense promise for drug discovery.
According to Morgan Stanley's healthcare forecast, the company's head of US biopharma research Terence Flynn estimates that “[every] 2.5% improvement in preclinical development success rates could lead to an additional 30-plus new drug approvals over 10 years,"" which would represent around $70 billion.

IWM,2024-09-27,How to play small-cap stocks: Ollie’s and RXO,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/play-small-cap-stocks-ollie-215227750.html,"Josh Bennett, senior portfolio manager and director of research at Alger, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how to play small-cap stocks during the rate-cutting cycle.
“We think the setup is pretty good for small caps now… The fact is, as the easing cycle begins, we should see that as favorable for small caps,” Bennett says, adding, “Historically, you've seen small caps trade at about a 10% premium to the large-cap index.” He highlights that “small caps just off 20-year lows in terms of relative valuation to large-cap stocks. So valuation setup is interesting.”
The portfolio manager says that while it does look like the economy is on the way to a soft landing if we were to enter a recessionary period, there are small stocks that can weather a challenging macro. “Small is not weak. And I think that it's interesting. A lot of people think that small-cap companies don't have the strength, but when you look at where we operate in the small-cap segment, we're looking for the highest quality small-cap growth names that we can find.”

Bennett names Ollies, a closeout retailer, as a buy in the small-cap space. “They're the largest player in the closeout industry. This is an enormous industry. $300 billion in closeout, and over $200 billion of that is non-apparel, which is where Ollie's plays. So they don't compete with TJX. They don't compete with Marshall's… Why is Ollie's a buy now? Because the consumer is looking for value more than they ever have before.”
The portfolio manager also calls on RXO, a truck brokerage company that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize its network, which connects trucks with companies that need to move things. “RXO should benefit as the industrial cycle begins to pick up. They'll see that benefit.” Bennett notes that if there are supply chain disruptions from the potential port strike, RXO could gain.

IWM,2024-09-20,Great investing debate: Growth or value stocks post-rate cuts?,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/great-investing-debate-growth-value-155038127.html,"It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come.
Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis.
Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. ""What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,"" he says, ""and in many cases, that can be growth stocks."" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE).
And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. ""I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks.""

Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring ""good old fashioned names"" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth.
Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. ""It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,"" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

IWM,2024-09-05,Arnott's Debut ETF Bets on Index Rejects,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arnotts-debut-etf-bets-index-203449363.html,"Legendary investor Rob Arnott is jumping into the ETF game with a strategy of buying stocks as they are dropped from major market indexes.
Arnott, founder and chairman of Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., is the brains behind the Research Affiliates Deletions ETF (NIXT), which begins trading Sept. 10.
NIXT will track the Research Affiliates Deletions Index made up of between 140 and 180 companies that have been removed from the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 indexes over the past five years.
The index methodology, which is a relatively straight forward small-cap value play, is based on Arnott’s research showing that companies dropped from indexes because they fall below market-capitalization minimums tend to outperform the respective indexes over the next five years.
“It’s like picking up coins dropped by a rich man walking down the street,” Arnott said, citing a 7% average 12-month outperformance for dropped stocks.
That average outperformance grows to 28% when the period is extended to five years, he added.
NIXT Strategy ""Quasi Active""
Arnott, whose Research Affiliates manages $150 billion through affiliated business relationships, describes the NIXT strategy as “quasi active” even though it is tracking an index.
Based on historical patterns of companies being dropped from indexes, Arnott anticipates NIXT will see an annual turnover rate of between 20% and 40%, with each stock being held for a five-year period.
To avoid crossing over into the proprietary methodologies of the S&P and Russell indexes, Arnott said the Research Affiliates Deletions Index is not designed to perfectly replicate the two brand name indexes, but that it will track similar universes of stocks.
To reduce portfolio turnover, he explained, a 10% banding is used so that a stock has to fall out of roughly the top 550 or 1100 names before it is treated as a deletion from an index.
“Our decision in sponsoring this ETF was driven by a desire to make the index deletions strategy as accessible as possible,” Arnott said.
NIXT has an expense ratio of 39 basis points but is only charging 9 basis points for the first 12 months of trading.

Thursday marks the one-month anniversary of the Aug. 5 ""yen shock"" — a mini-market panic that quickly spread throughout global markets after beginning in Japan the Monday following the July jobs report.
The Nikkei stock index (^N225) hemorrhaged 12% that Monday — its biggest one-day drop since 1987 — while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) plummeted 3%. The VIX Volatility Index (^VIX) spiked to 65, the third-highest level on record.
But almost as soon as the selling was over that morning, the eye-popping recovery began, which could be why there's not even a compelling agreed-upon name for the event. By midday in the US on that fateful Monday, the VIX had already fallen to 30 — its biggest intraday crash on record.
By mid-August, US stocks had already erased the losses. But this roller-coaster ride of volatility highlights some critical misconceptions about the VIX. And historical price action surrounding August shocks suggests that stocks are not in the clear just yet.
The VIX has long been dubbed the “fear gauge” by financial media (including by yours truly), but this moniker oversimplifies its function. As Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, explained on a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, “[The] VIX is not a fear gauge. It plays one on TV.”
The VIX measures the market's expectation of S&P 500 volatility over the next 30 days as calculated from options on the benchmark. It doesn’t account for actual fear but rather reflects the market's best estimate of future volatility, which often coincides with market fear or panic.
According to Sosnick, “VIX is the best proxy for the demand for [institutional] hedging protection because it is really the simplest way to do a short, quick hedge on a portfolio.”
Institutional and retail investors alike can tap deep and liquid markets for VIX futures and ETFs — along with options on those instruments. (But the VIX itself is an index and does not actually trade, much like the S&P 500.)
Investors might assume that a low VIX means markets are stable and not in need of hedging. But a low VIX is an affordable VIX. ""Buy protection when you can, not when you must,"" goes the Wall Street adage. Thinking back to the Monday market meltdown with hindsight, the right play was to sell the VIX by midday — by either shorting or covering prior long bets.
The BofA data analytics team has a historical warning for investors who have already moved past last month's shock.

IWM,2024-09-02,Why investors turn to ETFs during times of market stress,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-investors-turn-to-etfs-during-times-of-market-stress-190447871.html,"Market volatility often prompts investors to kick the tires on their portfolio, which for US investors has often meant turning to exchange traded funds, or ETFs, to refresh positions or act on new ideas.
Since the pandemic, the ETF market has roughly doubled in size — as of the end of the first quarter, (ETFs) represented $7.1 trillion, or 13% of the US stock market and 2.8% of the US bond market, up from $3.5 trillion in 2019, according to BlackRock.
Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas Asset Management, recently stopped by Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast and highlighted some of the pros and cons of ETFs for investors.
A key advantage for ETFs is cost — the fees charged to investors have plummeted amid the race to zero commissions among the big brokers.
""You can buy an S&P 500 fund for 2 or 3 basis points. That's nothing,"" said Sohn.
To simply buy one share of each component of the S&P 500 would cost about $105,000. To replicate the entire index according to each stock's weight would cost a minimum of $15,500,000, according to Yahoo Finance calculations, which doesn't include brokerage commissions. In contrast, an annual fee of 3 basis points — or 0.03% — on an ETF means an investor would pay 30 cents for every $1,000 invested.
ETFs also tap a wide range of markets and strategies, which is essential for diversification.
Sohn highlighted that ETFs give investors ""access to virtually any market around the globe.""
In addition to geographic and asset class diversification, ETFs have evolved to mimic certain hedge fund strategies. So-called smart beta ETFs, for instance, use predetermined rules for selecting investments in a fund.
Sohn also highlighted transparency as a key benefit, as ETFs report holdings on a daily basis.
""I can look at the holdings every day. I know what ingredients are in my investment,"" said Sohn.
ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but a key distinction is intraday liquidity. ETFs can be traded throughout the day, while mutual funds can only be bought and sold on the close.
""I can trade them throughout the day if I wanted to,"" said Sohn. ""Or if I'm a large investor, I can move large amounts of money to these funds.""
Many ETFs also offer significant tax advantages, which Sohn described as their ""secret sauce.""
And during times of market stress and volatility, ETFs can act as ""shock absorbers."" If an investor is concerned about a stock's decline, Sohn explained, ""they can buy an ETF of its peers to diversify and mitigate risk.""

IWM,2024-08-28,Why gold is outperforming nearly everything so far this year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gold-is-outperforming-nearly-everything-so-far-this-year-100022695.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
Gold futures (GC=F) have been surfing record highs, with Monday's prices hitting $2,555.2 per ounce, sending the value of a 400 troy ounce gold bar to $1,022,080.
The yellow metal has forged meteoric gains this year, emerging as the world's second-best-performing asset next to crypto. Its 23% year-to-date gain edges out the megacap-loaded Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) — itself up a healthy 18%. (A proxy for the crypto market writ large, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW), is up 47% this year.)
According to BofA Global Research, gold funds just absorbed the largest inflows in four weeks, attracting $1.1 billion. Yet, the broader trend has actually seen $2.5 billion in outflows year to date, suggesting that underlying strength is coming from outside traditional fund flows.
Central banks — especially those of developing countries — have been buying the barbarous relic at a record clip. According to the World Gold Council, central banks have purchased 290 tonnes in the first quarter alone, beating out the prior Q1 record from 2023 and setting CBs on a path to record gold purchases in 2024 that are estimated to easily eclipse 1,000 tonnes.
""Not only is the long-standing trend in central bank gold buying firmly intact, it also continues to be dominated by banks from emerging markets,"" wrote the Gold Council.
In that regard, Turkey tops the buy list this year with 30 tonnes purchased in the first quarter — lifting its gold reserves to 570 tonnes. China bought 27 tonnes in Q1, making it the 17th consecutive quarter of purchases and also bringing its holdings to 2,262 tonnes. Other notable purchasers include India, Kazakhstan, the Czech Republic, Oman, and Singapore.
The central bank buying spree has solidified gold's status as a reserve asset. According to BofA, gold has now surpassed the euro to become the world's largest reserve asset second only to the US dollar, representing 16% of the reserve pool.
The precious metal’s performance can be attributed to its unique position as a real asset with one of the lowest correlations to stocks across asset classes, making it a safe haven from market swings and inflation.
According to Tom Bruni, head of market research at StockTwits, in a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, ""We're seeing gold being used as an uncertainty hedge.""
Bruni also emphasized gold's appeal to traders due to its price action. ""With gold breaking out above its 2011 highs, it's drawing significant attention from trend followers and technical analysts alike.""

Wall Street has long preached the virtues of holding bonds in a balanced investment portfolio.
This gospel says investors should steer 60% of their investments into stocks and 40% to bonds to enjoy the benefits of diversification, with uncorrelated returns helping protect investors through the market's ups and downs.
But according to Trent Smalley, a Chartered Market Technician and portfolio manager at JSPM, that advice may not be as universal as it seems — especially for younger investors.
""Young people don't need bonds unless they get extremely uncomfortable,"" Smalley said during the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast (listen below). ""Bonds are there to reduce the volatility of a portfolio. But if you're young enough, really none of that matters.""
In the 30 years from 1993 to 2023, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8%. Reinvesting dividends would have boosted that return to 9.9%, according to Yahoo Finance calculations.
Over the same 30-year period, the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index had a compounded annual growth rate of 3.3%. From its peak in late 2021 to its bottom a year later, it sunk 17.4% — a large drawdown by historical standards.

""Sometimes [the stock market's returns are] lumpy. Sometimes you get 30% a year. Sometimes, like in 2022, you're down 20%,"" said Smalley.
""If you're a young person and every two weeks you get paid by your company — if you're lucky enough you've got a 401(k) and you've got a company that will match a certain percent of that — you want the market to go down,"" Smalley added.
Bonds have also traditionally served as the go-to asset for reducing portfolio volatility and generating a steady income.
But younger investors, who have decades of earning potential ahead of them, don’t necessarily need that stability or the recurring income that comes from regular interest (or coupon) payments — a feature of bonds that many retirees depend on.
The diversification argument in favor of bonds has also been challenged in recent years.
And since 2021, stock and bond moves have been increasingly correlated, meaning they tend to both go up or down together. As the correlation between bonds and stocks increases, the diversification benefits diminish.
Bonds suffered one of their worst years on record in 2022 alongside the S&P 500's steepest annual drop since 2008. As a result, ""mom and pop"" investors in 60/40 portfolios were hit particularly hard.

Whether charting technical indicators or dissecting an earnings report, finding themes that repeat can offer investors a sense of predictability amid chaotic markets.
The most reliable patterns in finance tend to be based on the calendar year.
Seasonality, as it's called, refers to predictable and recurring changes in markets that tend to happen at the same time every year. And though markets have steadied after last week's abrupt sell-off, stock market bears looking at seasonal patterns will be encouraged by this history ahead of this year's election.
Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, recently joined Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast to break down some of these patterns for investors. Though Detrick has long been an advocate for understanding the forces of seasonality at work in the markets, he cautioned: ""We would never blindly just invest in seasonality.""
Still, investors have nearly a century of solid data from the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to analyze market trends.
For example, consumer spending usually increases during the holiday season. Back-to-school shopping boosts retail sales in late August and early September. And summer vacations or holidays can slow down overall market activity and lower trading volumes.
All of this creates observable patterns in the market that influence prices of stocks, bonds, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. This data allows returns from each day of the year to be analyzed to find the average loss or gain, and those results can be combined to create a seasonality map for the year.
The chart shows that stocks tend to go up each year, but average annual gains are interrupted by a big downturn from September into October. This data reflects the numerous market crashes that have occurred in September and October, including Black Monday in October 1987 and Black Tuesday in October 1929.
Toward the end of October, things tend to turn around, on average, and stocks often rise into year-end, capped off by the much-vaunted Santa Claus Rally.
But August is also no picnic for investors, either.
""Historically, when August is down, it tends to really be down more than any other month,"" Detrick said, citing significant events such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the Asian Contagion in 1997, and the downgrade of US debt by S&P in 2011.
As the S&P 500's seasonality map shows, not much happens in August — on average.
But we can see the effects of a pickup in volatility by studying the seasonality of the VIX (^VIX), which offers a different set of seasonal clues for investors to decipher.

The long-term bond market proxy, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), jumped 3.6% last month while the stock market benchmark, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY), had a modest gain of 1.2%.
July’s market story is not just “risk-off,” but also one of market rotation in the equity space, as small-cap funds like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) produced a massive gain of 10.3% in the month while big-tech ETFs like the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) fell 3.3%.
Why Long Term Treasury, Russell 2000 ETFs Won in July
The outperformance of both long-term Treasury ETFs and Russell 2000 ETFs in July can be attributed to changing investor expectations about interest rates and economic growth, as well as perceived high valuations for mega-cap technology companies. This led to a rotation of assets from large-cap growth stocks to safer havens and smaller, more cyclical companies.
Long-Term Treasury ETFs
Bond yields decline: The primary reason for the outperformance of long-term Treasury ETFs in July was a decline in bond yields, which have an inverse relationship with bond prices. Bonds with longer maturities (higher duration) are more rate sensitive than short-term bonds.
Fed rate expectations: Expectations of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts due to easing inflation contributed to the decline in bond yields, boosting the value of long-term Treasury bonds.
Safe-haven asset: Treasuries are often considered safe-haven assets, and during periods of market uncertainty or economic slowdown, investors tend to flock to these bonds.
Russell 2000 ETFs
Small-cap rally: The Russell 2000 index is composed of small-cap stocks, which tend to be more cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions.
Interest rate expectations: The expectation of potential interest rate cuts is generally positive for small-cap companies, as lower borrowing costs can stimulate economic growth and benefit these businesses.
Rotation from large-cap to small-cap: There was a noticeable shift in investor sentiment away from large-cap tech stocks (heavily represented in the S&P 500) and toward smaller companies.
Outlook: Long-Term Treasury, Russell 2000 ETFs
Here are potential scenarios to watch and consider for long-term Treasury ETFs and Russell 2000 ETFs in the coming months:
Long-Term Treasury ETFs
Interest rate sensitivity: The primary driver for long-term Treasury ETFs remains interest rate movements. If interest rates continue to decline, these ETFs could continue to perform well. However, if rates start to rise, their value will likely decrease.
Economic outlook: The overall economic health will also influence Treasury ETF performance. A recession could lead to increased demand for safe-haven assets like Treasuries, while a strong economy might push investors toward riskier assets.

An overarching feeling of optimism about both the economy and markets emerges from the third volume of the Yahoo Finance Chartbook, a trend similar to that seen in volume two in late January.
Across the 32 charts compiled by economists and strategists on Wall Street, we see broad confidence that the US economy can still achieve the vaunted ""soft landing"" outcome following the Fed's historic rate-hiking cycle.
Following a nearly 17% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) so far this year, equity strategists see room for the bull market to run further, as many areas of the market have only recently joined the rally.
However, just past the midpoint of 2024, there is some doubt about how long this can last without significant changes.
The risks aren't hard to find with the US presidential election looming. A stock market pullback is more than overdue, according to some market data. And a resilient economy continues to straddle the fine line between normalization from pre-pandemic trends and the start of a broader slowdown.
Economists are clamoring for changes to monetary policy to ensure the Fed can land the plane safely. Investors are also highlighting new opportunities and a potential stock market rotation as artificial intelligence enthusiasm moves into its next phase.
This volume of the Chartbook reflects markets and the economy at what Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius called an ""inflection point,"" where many things appear the same for now — but almost everything seems on the cusp of looking quite different.

The case for cutting rates
David Kelly, chief global strategist, JPMorgan Asset Management Market Insights Team
""Stubborn inflation during the first quarter dashed hopes for aggressive policy easing this year. That said, inflation remains below its June 2022 peak, and disinflationary momentum has regathered steam in recent months. In fact, headline inflation rose by just 3.0% y/y in June, well below the 3.5% pace recorded just three months prior.
""While food and energy prices have been well-behaved and core goods have been a steady source of disinflation, gains in shelter and auto insurance have remained elevated, prolonging inflation’s journey back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. However, with real-time data across both categories pointing to easing price pressures, inflation should continue its slow descent and return to 2% by the middle of next year. If, as expected, inflationary pressures ease through the summer, the Federal Reserve should feel comfortable cutting rates twice this year, delivering a first cut in September.""

IWM,2024-07-18,Small-cap debate continues as rally in Russell 2000 stalls,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-cap-debate-continues-as-rally-in-russell-2000-stalls-194527842.html,"One of Wall Street's favorite calls to start 2024 has finally been leading the stock market rally.
After significantly underperforming the broader market for the first six months of the year, small caps have soared over the past week. The historic rally followed a better-than-expected June inflation reading that has markets increasingly optimistic about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
In the past month, the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index has gained about 8%, far outpacing the S&P 500's less than 1% in the same period. On Thursday, however, the move showed some signs of stalling out. The Russell 2000 dropped more than 2%, extending losses from Wednesday's trading session.
And the pressing question among Wall Street strategists right now is whether the rally has more room to run.

""We think there is room for the rotation into low quality to persist if rate cuts remain priced and the Trump 2.0 trade carries on ahead of US elections,"" UBS Investment Bank US equity derivatives strategist Maxwell Grinacoff wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.
Grinacoff added that the keys to the rally continuing include further cooling in inflation and economic data showing similar, or higher, levels of growth.
From the day of the latest inflation print on July 11 through July 16, the rally in small caps was historic.
As investors moved to price in a 100% chance of an interest rate cut from the Fed in September, the Russell 2000 rose than 11% in five trading days, including a more than 3% bounce on Tuesday alone. This marked the largest outperformance from the S&P 500 in five-day period on record, per Bespoke Investment Group.
DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas noted this historic action signals ""investor sentiment has shifted dramatically and the move very likely has further to run.""

On Wednesday, Bank of America's head of US equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian told Yahoo Finance the trend in small caps is ""likely to persist.""
But to Subramanian that doesn't mean simply buying the Russell 2000 index is the right trade.
Subramanian highlighted about one-third of the Russell 2000 isn't profitable, and overall the index faces far more refinancing risks amid higher interest rates than an index like the S&P 500.
""Their valuations are at levels that would warrant a pretty equitable comeback,"" Subramanian said.
Still, Subramanian isn't overly confident in the index as a whole, noting that areas that have more refinancing risk or credit sensitivity are ""potentially still in the penalty box until the Fed actually begins to cut rates.""

Villere & Co. portfolio manager Sandy Villere joins Market Domination to talk about how investors can play small cap stocks as the market begins to rotate out of the tech trade.
Villere comments on the outlook for small caps:
""I mean we're expecting robust earnings growth, right, and even when rates go down right, even if you're looking at 14.5 times earnings. Remember when rates go down and there's a lot of leverage that small caps use, so I think the earnings are actually going to be even better than what are currently modeled into those forecasts. So I think small caps have an incredible tailwind behind them. And a great opportunity to get involved again.""
He goes on to weigh in on several small-cap stocks On Holding (ONON), First Hawaiian (FHB), and Option Care Health (OPCH).

IWM,2024-07-17,It's not 'too late' to invest in small caps: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/not-too-invest-small-caps-152259921.html,"The Russell 2000 (^RUT) has risen by more than 10% in the last five trading sessions, marking the longest streak of gains for the small-cap index since April 2020. MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Chris Grisanti joins Catalysts to discuss the growth of small caps and how investors should position their portfolios.
Grisanti believes that small caps are still ""underpriced,"" despite having the Russell 2000 having ""its biggest move in terms of standard deviations that we've seen in more than 30 years over the last week."" He calls the rally a ""convincing reversal"" and believes that its growth does not rely on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.
""It would scare me if the Fed cut rates... the Fed cuts rates not to give you a break, but because bad things are starting to happen. The economy is starting to slow, earnings are starting to get lower. So if the Fed cuts, they're seeing something that's scaring them.""
He adds that small-cap stocks are cheap buying opportunities: ""I don't think it's too late to initiate positions if you haven't already.""

IWM,2024-07-15,"Investors Bought Up IWM, RSP Last Week",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-bought-iwm-rsp-last-211949252.html,"A cool $36 billion flowed into U.S.-listed ETFs during the week ending Friday, July 12, pushing year-to-date inflows above $406 billion.

U.S. equity ETFs pulled in the bulk of the weekly inflows as stocks continued to hit record highs, but fixed income ETFs also saw demand as rate cut expectations ticked higher following the latest inflation data.

The S&P 500 was up by almost 19% on a year-to-date basis on Friday. Investors cheered data which showed a smaller-than-expected increase in consumer prices last month.

The probability of a rate cut in September neared 90% after the CPI data came out, which also lent support to bond prices.

Individual flows winners for last week include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).

Small caps handily outperformed their large cap counterparts last week as investors rotated into cheaper stocks from the megacap stocks that have led this year’s rally.

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) was also in high demand with weekly inflows of $1 billion. The daily return differential between RSP and SPY on Thursday—the day the CPI data came out—was the largest since 2020.

Still, despite there being some rotation from megacaps to smaller stocks, the tech giants that dominate the S&P 500 remain close to their all-time highs. 

In other words, everything seems to be working all of a sudden—mega caps, small caps and everything in between.

Only one ETF saw outflows of more than $1 billion last week: the Invesco Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor ETF (OMFL). 

The Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 2X Shares (SOXL) and the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) followed suit with outflows of $663 million and $446 million, respectively, on what seems to be profit taking after huge rallies.

The two ETFs are up 106% and 62%, respectively, so far this year.

IWM,2024-07-09,Does SPY and Its 18% Rise Reflect U.S. Markets?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-spy-18-rise-reflect-205114548.html,"Depending upon which ETF you look at, the U.S. stock market’s performance so far this year has been tepid, fantastic or more likely, somewhere in between.
The world’s largest exchange-traded fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has broken record highs on its way to gaining 18% this year, just past the year's midway point.

Seen through a different lens, the market’s performance looks much less impressive. The narrower SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) is up just 5.1% year-to-date. DIA’s return is similar to 4.7% gain for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), while it’s far superior to the mere 0.9% return for the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM).

The wide-ranging returns for various U.S. stock market ETFs is a reflection of the current environment which has favored megacap tech companies above all else. 

One stock alone—Nvidia—has boosted SPY’s return by almost 500 basis points, while high interest rates have weighed on the profitability of many of the smaller companies that make up IWM.

Of course, IWM is hardly reflective of the overall U.S. stock market. The combined market cap of the Russell 2000 index is $2.8 trillion, less than Nvidia on its own.

But the Dow Jones, as imperfect as it is, has historically been a decent indicator of how the stock market is faring. And maybe it still is.

DIA’s return matches that of RSP, an ETF which tracks a version of the S&P 500 where every holding is equally weighted. It puts much less emphasis on the giant companies that dominate the traditional S&P 500.

The gap between SPY and RSP is currently around 1,300 basis points, which would be the second-largest performance differential for the ETFs since RSP’s inception in 2003 (in 2009, RSP soared almost 45%, trouncing the 26% gain for SPY).

Which ETF is more indicative of the performance of the U.S. stock market is open for debate. While the traditional S&P 500 tracked by SPY is the most widely-followed index of U.S. stocks, if the index continues to outperform its equal-weighted counterpart by leaps and bounds due to the incredible performance of a handful of stocks, an increasing number of investors may question whether it truly represents the stock market at large.

One firm that has been investing in OpenAI is Ark Invest.
Cathie Wood, ARK Invest's CEO and CIO, is betting big on AI. She says OpenAI, along with Anthropic, xAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) are ""stealing the march"" in the space.
While many investors are concerned about when companies will start seeing returns on their AI investments, Wood is hopeful. When asked about when OpenAI will start to turn a profit, she points to the development of agentic AI, which she thinks will open the door to more profitability, given that companies will be able to charge more for it.
Despite some recent executive departures at OpenAI, Wood is confident in the startup's leadership, praising both CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. She notes that ""what we witness in companies that are growing very quickly from startup into scaling is you need a different kind of management team.""

When it comes to competition between AI firms, Wood likes it. ""Competition is good. It's going to make this space more competitive and more effective, I think, longer term,"" she says.
On the possibility of a company like OpenAI going public, Wood argues ""a lot of companies are staying private longer. They just don't want to deal with the regulation in the public equity markets. And they also don't want to deal with the very short-term oriented or short-term investment time horizon of shareholders in the public equity markets."" However, she does think the public market could become more appealing with interest rates coming down and if investors were willing to stomach the longer-term time horizons some of these companies are working with.

LIT,2024-10-04,Albemarle Stock Surge Despite Uncertainty of Rio Tinto's Lithium Acquisitions,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/albemarle-stock-surge-despite-uncertainty-153320977.html,"October 4, 2024 - Rises on news that Rio Tinto Plc (NYSE:RIO) is considering lithium acquisitions, as reported by The Australian despite no guarantee of successful acquisition.
The Australian report suggests that Rio Tinto Plc is considering Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) and Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), two major players in lithium market, as potential targets. But it's important to note that negotiations are ongoing, and there is no guarantee of a successful acquisition.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ALB.
The interest in acquiring major players in the lithium space aligns with the growing demand for lithium batteries, primarily driven by the growing demand of electric vehicles and meeting the company's sustainability goals. The acquisition, which is not yet exercised, has caused Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock to rise 5% upon the market opening on October 5, 2024.
For information, Albemarle Corporation is a leading global producer of lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, and is also a major player in the production of catalysts used in refining and petrochemical processes. While Arcadium Lithium is a Canadian exploration and development company focused on lithium projects in North America.
To add a new revenue stream for Rio Tinto, beyond its traditional mining commodities, by integrating a new acquisition of lithium producers to Tinto's portfolio could be complex, requiring careful planning and execution.
Recent Stock Performance and Trends to Consider:
Volatility: ALB stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, primarily driven by fluctuations in lithium prices.
Lithium Demand: The growing demand for lithium batteries, driven by the electric vehicle market, has been a key factor influencing ALB's stock performance.
Supply and Demand Dynamics: Changes in lithium supply and demand dynamics, including new production capacity and geopolitical factors, can also impact ALB's stock price.
Technological Advancements: Advances in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries, could potentially impact the demand for lithium and, consequently, ALB's business.
And also there are significant revenue increases experienced by Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) in 2022 and 2023.
Albemarle Stock Surge Despite Uncertainty of Rio Tinto's Lithium Acquisitions
The significant revenue increases were attributed to several factors such as the Booming Lithium Market by the rapid expansion of the electric vehicle growth causing Albermarle to expand its lithium production capacity to meet the growing demand and therefore contributing to higher revenues. Increased production and the rising lithium prices make increased revenue.

LIT,2024-10-04,5 Top Stocks to Buy in October,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stocks-buy-october-104500040.html,"With the first three quarters of the calendar year in the books, investors are strolling into October with the major indexes at all-time highs and a more than 20% year-to-date gain in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Go back even further, and the S&P 500 is up a staggering 50% since the start of 2023.
Efficiency improvements and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered innovations are sending ripple effects through the stock market -- from changing how legacy companies do business to setting the stage for more demand for energy and electricity to power data centers.
The Federal Reserve just announced its first interest rate cut in four years, which was quickly followed by a Chinese stimulus package and rate cuts. With the cost of capital getting cheaper, there's reason to believe consumer spending could get a much-needed uptick this fall.
Despite all the momentum heading into October, investors should still take a long-term approach. They should only invest in companies that they believe can deliver on promises and navigate the cycle, and that are worth holding for at least three to five years. Here's why five Fool.com contributors picked Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) as top stocks to buy in October.

It's time to pounce on affordable Berkshire shares
Anders Bylund (Berkshire Hathaway): It's rarely a bad time to invest in Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett's insurance-based investing machine almost always looks ready to beat the stock market in the long run.
But you know what Buffett says about pricing. He prefers buying stock in amazing companies at a fair price. That's his secret recipe for keeping business risks low and investor returns high. That wisdom-packed quote applies perfectly to Berkshire's own stock right now.
The company is not putting much money in the market these days. Berkshire's cash and short-term investment reserves have swelled to $277 billion, crushing the former record of $150 billion in the fall of 2021. More than 21% of Berkshire's assets are held in the form of cash or liquid government bonds. That's not exactly a record, but it's the highest ratio seen since the aftermath of the dot-com bubble popping.
That's exciting to me. I can't wait to see what the investing legend will invest in when the time is right. But Berkshire's market makers have a different view, driving the stock 3% lower in September. Whether you're buying the high-priced Class A shares or the more affordable Class B stock, Berkshire trades at just 14.6 times trailing earnings today.

LIT,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

LIT,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

LIT,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.
Watch the video above to hear some of Rosenbluth's ETF plays for the port strike affecting the US's East and Gulf Coasts.

LIT,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

LIT,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

LIT,2024-10-01,"Chinese Stocks Are Soaring, but So Are These 3 Dividend Stocks That Are Up Between 5% and 16% in 3 Days",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-stocks-soaring-3-dividend-083000538.html,"China just released a stimulus package to help the country reach its 5% economic growth target for 2024 and jolt its struggling housing and equity markets. The announcement came after the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled a 50-basis-point (0.5%) rate cut to counter rising unemployment and help consumers who have been hit hard by inflation and soaring housing costs.
The stimulus package led to a surge in Chinese stock prices and U.S.-based companies exposed to China. Here's why Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), and Estee Lauder (NYSE: EL) surged between 5% and 16% from Sept. 24 to Sept. 26, and whether these dividend stocks are worth buying now.
Image source: Getty Images.
A global bellwether across energy and industrials
Caterpillar hit a new intraday all-time high on Sept. 26 and is now up more than 40% year to date. The stock has been roaring higher in response to U.S. rate cuts and, now, the China stimulus package.
Caterpillar is known for its construction machinery business. But in 2023, its energy and transportation segment produced more revenue than construction. The segment includes oil and gas, power generation, industrial applications, and transportation. Resource industries, which are mainly focused on mining, earned nearly half as much revenue as construction.
Caterpillar is also highly diversified geographically. Fifty-four percent of 2023 sales came from outside the U.S. The Asia-Pacific region (led by China) contributed $11.73 billion in 2023 sales -- or 17.5% of total sales. Caterpillar's mining business, in particular, is enormous in China.
China's stimulus is excellent news for Caterpillar, which has seen weakness across its Asia/Pacific business. If Caterpillar can sustain its momentum, the stock could remain a good value. In the following chart, you can see that Caterpillar's stock price has been soaring in lockstep with earnings growth.
CAT Chart
However, analyst average estimates had called for just $22.12 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $22.87 in 2025,  implying slowing growth.
Since Caterpillar is a cyclical company, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio tends to be low during expansion periods and high during downturns. So while its 17.8 P/E doesn't look too pricey at first glance, it is buoyed by abnormally high trailing earnings. The valuation could begin to look much more expensive if growth slows.
Buying Caterpillar now is a bet that the U.S. and China's interest rate cuts will spur economic growth and help both countries avoid recessions. Even if Caterpillar sells off, investors can take solace in its dividend, which which at 1.4% isn't stellar, but the company has increased it for 30 consecutive years.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

It's not too late to play the China stimulus rally: Strategist

yesterday
As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

LIT,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

LIT,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

LIT,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

MOAT,2024-04-05,Breaking Down VanEck's 2 New Moat ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breaking-down-vanecks-2-moat-120000649.html,"The VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT) has been a hit with investors. The fund has nearly $15 billion in assets under management thanks to its compelling strategy and strong performance.
Since its inception over a decade ago, MOAT is up 405%, besting the 370% return for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). 
 
Piggybacking on the success of its flagship moat ETF, VanEck recently launched a pair of more targeted funds that utilize a similar strategy, the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat Value ETF (MVAL) and the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat Growth ETF (MGRO).
What makes these ETFs different than MOAT? And who are they designed for?

MOAT,2023-12-20,Top ETF trends heading into 2024,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/top-etf-trends-heading-2024-185319279.html,"With the Federal Reserve signaling rate cuts in 2024, a potential Santa Claus rally on tap, tax-loss harvesting activity, and positioning for the new year, there is a lot of money moving around the market right now. Some of that money is going into ETFs, with a space that has seen inflows surge recently.
ETF Think Tank Director of Research Cinthia Murphy joins Yahoo Finance Live to explain some of the trends driving money into ETFs. Some of the trends she is seeing are investors ""looking for a little quality, look for economic moat"" and ""things like your free cash flow companies, your cash cows, or shareholder yield ETFs.""

Video Transcript
RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, let's take a look at what we're seeing with markets. All three averages in the green this morning. Now, the S&P 500 just shy of that record set in January of last year, increasing inflows into ETFs helping fuel the most recent rally.
According to Morningstar Direct, more than 70 mutual funds have converted to ETFs since early 2021 and three dozen of those have happened in 2023 alone. SPDR, S&P 500 ETF has seen the biggest inflows, raking in $20.8 billion, the largest amount since the fund began in 1993 according to Bloomberg Intelligence. To discuss how investors should position themselves going into 2024, let's bring in Cinthia Murphy, ETF Think Tank director of research. She joins us as part of our ETF report brought to you by Invesco QQQ.
Thank you for joining us this morning. So we know a lot of people had some of this cash on the sidelines that they had then put into mutual funds. But then seeing them convert it into ETFs, what do people need to know going into the end of this year and heading into 2024 about how to play this smartly?
CINTHIA MURPHY: Yeah. Hi, it's been a crazy month so far this year. I mean, as you pointed out, the amount of money going into a fund like SPY, the S&P 500 ETF, and some of these large-cap equity ETFs has been massive. I mean I think SPY took in something like $35 billion in the last week alone. So there's been a lot of positioning going into 2024.
Now, what's important to remember here is a couple of things. In December, we tend to see big flows into ETFs anyway traditionally. Not only there's a seasonality to the market where US equities tend to perform well in December, I saw a statistic recently that said 70% of the time the Dow Jones industrial average is up in December regardless of the market environment. So it's a good time for US equities in general.

NUSI,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

NUSI,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

NUSI,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

NUSI,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

NUSI,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

NUSI,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) – Average Daily Volume: 169.7 million shares

NUSI,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

NUSI,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

NUSI,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

NUSI,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

NUSI,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:

2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia

4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

NUSI,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

PAVE,2024-04-22,Change Is Never Easy: New Global X CEO,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/change-never-easy-global-x-212319440.html,"Ryan O’Connor
Eleven days into his tenure as the chief executive officer of Global X ETFs, Ryan O’Connor is more focused on the future of the $47 billion asset management firm than the recent past, which includes a raft of executive-level departures since November.
For example, he cites the $3.1 billion worth of net flows this year that have already surpassed the $2.3 billion worth of net flows for all of last year as evidence of a receptive market.
But O’Connor, 40, who joined Global X from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, acknowledges that the direction of the company now will factor in some of its missteps before he arrived.
“Change is never easy, but I really see it as a natural evolution of the platform,” O’Connor told etf.com during his first media interview since joining Global X.
That change, which unfolded prior to the announced hiring of O’Connor in late February includes departures by Chief Investment Officer Jon Maier, head of finance Ronnie Riven, chief executive Luis Berruga, Chief Operating Officer John Belanger, head of human resource Crystal Christy and Bruno Stein, who led a small operation in Brazil.
The departures were a blend of voluntary and involuntary, and in some cases may have been tied to management shortcomings from basic things, including a stagnant model portfolio business and more than a dozen ETFs launched over the past few years that failed to reach the $10 million mark.
In January, Global X closed 19 ETFs, cutting its total lineup to 91. The closed funds included an eclectic mix of strategies focused on China, Pakistan, healthcare, real estate and cannabis.
Global X also pulled its filing for a spot bitcoin ETF, potentially missing out of inflows that have poured into that category since the ETFs were approved in January.
“A lot of times when the people who are entrepreneurial cash out and leave, the company is just not the same,” said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas referring to the 2018 acquisition of Global X by Korean global financial conglomerate Mirae Asset Global Investments.
One of Mirae’s first moves as owner of what was then a $10.2 billion ETF shop was to install Berruga as CEO. The investment looked like a homerun by 2021 when the appeal of thematic strategies brought in $21 billion, doubling the size of Global X.
But Berruga was fired in November 2023 and Thomas Park, co-CEO of Mirae’s U.S. business, was installed as Global X’s interim CEO.
Mirae responded to a request for comment with the following emailed statement, “We have seen significant momentum and innovation coming out of Global X. In order to maintain that momentum and take the brand to the next level, we made a decision to refocus the company's strategic direction. Given his significant ETF experience and insights, Ryan is playing a key role in that evolution.”

PAVE,2024-04-16,"Global X Exits, Closures Raise Questions Over Future",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-x-exits-closures-raise-214336520.html,"Questions are mounting about the future of Global X ETFs, after the $47 billion ETF issuer lost a handful of senior executives in recent months while cutting its fund lineup.
Chief investment officer Jon Maier and head of finance Ronnie Riven are both stepping down, The Wall Street Journal recently reported. Since November, the New York-based company lost chief executive Luis Berruga, chief operating officer John Belanger, head of human resources Crystal Christy and Bruno Stein, who led operations in Brazil, The Journal said.
Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas questioned whether executives are being forced out or leaving on their own.
“They’re losing all of their ETF people,” Balchunas said in an interview. “I don’t know anyone there anymore, and that’s bad because I get around. They don’t pitch stories or even send out press releases anymore.”
Global X, which brought on Ryan O'Connor as its new CEO on April 8, emailed a statement in response to a request for comment that reads in part, “Recent statements made about Global X are baseless and without merit. When we parted ways with the former CEO, we knew there would be additional changes and we expect more to come as we position ourselves for the future.”
“Ryan’s nearly two decades of industry experience and direct role in innovative product development weighed heavily in our decision to appoint him as CEO,” the statement continued.
In January, Global X closed 19 ETFs, cutting its total lineup to 90. The closed funds were small and included a mixture of strategies focused on China, Pakistan, healthcare, real estate and cannabis.
Trimming unprofitable ETFs from a lineup is common across the industry. Still, at the end of January Global X withdrew its application with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot bitcoin ETF, just weeks after 11 such funds had been approved and went on to pull in billions in inflows.

QYLD,2024-05-21,Actively Managed and Outcome-Based ETFs Take Center Stage in 2024,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/actively-managed-outcome-based-etfs-120000665.html,"In an interview with etf.com, Giang Bui, Head of U.S. Equities & ETPs at Nasdaq and member of the etf.com editorial advisory board, discussed key trends shaping the ETF landscape in 2024. Bui highlighted the continued dominance of actively managed ETFs, which comprised two-thirds of new launches year-to-date, exceeding even 2023's record pace.
""Active equity makes up about half of new launches,"" Bui noted, reflecting investor appetite for professional stock selection in the current market environment. Outcome-based strategies, designed to achieve specific goals like risk management or income generation, remain a significant driver of innovation.
However, the hottest topic in ETFs this year undoubtedly revolves around Bitcoin. ""It's been really exciting to see all the adoption and how well [the bitcoin ETFs] are trading,"" Bui remarked, emphasizing their operational efficiency and asset accumulation.
Exchanges Facilitate Investor Access
Bui also addressed the crucial role exchanges play in ensuring investor access to ETFs. Nasdaq, boasting over 600 listed ETFs with a combined value of $1 trillion, takes pride in supporting issuers throughout the entire product lifecycle.
""We partner with issuers on ETF education and provide robust liquidity support,"" Bui explained. This commitment translates to a smooth and efficient experience for investors and financial advisors seeking to incorporate ETFs into their portfolios.
Nasdaq Selected as Winner for Index Provider of the Year
On a separate note, Bui expressed enthusiasm about Nasdaq's nomination for etf.com's Index Provider of the Year award. ""We've been in the index space for over 50 years,"" Bui said, acknowledging the recognition from a respected industry publication.
More importantly, Bui emphasized Nasdaq's dedication to supporting issuers who leverage their indexes. ""We're excited to be partnering with them to provide access to strategies about emerging themes and cater to investor demand,"" Bui concluded.
This conversation underscores the dynamism of the ETF industry in 2024. Actively managed and outcome-based options continue to gain traction, while innovative products like bitcoin ETFs capture investor imagination. With continued exchange support, investors can expect an even more robust and accessible ETF landscape in the years to come.

QYLD,2024-04-22,Change Is Never Easy: New Global X CEO,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/change-never-easy-global-x-212319440.html,"Ryan O’Connor
Eleven days into his tenure as the chief executive officer of Global X ETFs, Ryan O’Connor is more focused on the future of the $47 billion asset management firm than the recent past, which includes a raft of executive-level departures since November.
For example, he cites the $3.1 billion worth of net flows this year that have already surpassed the $2.3 billion worth of net flows for all of last year as evidence of a receptive market.
But O’Connor, 40, who joined Global X from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, acknowledges that the direction of the company now will factor in some of its missteps before he arrived.
“Change is never easy, but I really see it as a natural evolution of the platform,” O’Connor told etf.com during his first media interview since joining Global X.
That change, which unfolded prior to the announced hiring of O’Connor in late February includes departures by Chief Investment Officer Jon Maier, head of finance Ronnie Riven, chief executive Luis Berruga, Chief Operating Officer John Belanger, head of human resource Crystal Christy and Bruno Stein, who led a small operation in Brazil.
The departures were a blend of voluntary and involuntary, and in some cases may have been tied to management shortcomings from basic things, including a stagnant model portfolio business and more than a dozen ETFs launched over the past few years that failed to reach the $10 million mark.
In January, Global X closed 19 ETFs, cutting its total lineup to 91. The closed funds included an eclectic mix of strategies focused on China, Pakistan, healthcare, real estate and cannabis.
Global X also pulled its filing for a spot bitcoin ETF, potentially missing out of inflows that have poured into that category since the ETFs were approved in January.
“A lot of times when the people who are entrepreneurial cash out and leave, the company is just not the same,” said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas referring to the 2018 acquisition of Global X by Korean global financial conglomerate Mirae Asset Global Investments.
One of Mirae’s first moves as owner of what was then a $10.2 billion ETF shop was to install Berruga as CEO. The investment looked like a homerun by 2021 when the appeal of thematic strategies brought in $21 billion, doubling the size of Global X.
But Berruga was fired in November 2023 and Thomas Park, co-CEO of Mirae’s U.S. business, was installed as Global X’s interim CEO.
Mirae responded to a request for comment with the following emailed statement, “We have seen significant momentum and innovation coming out of Global X. In order to maintain that momentum and take the brand to the next level, we made a decision to refocus the company's strategic direction. Given his significant ETF experience and insights, Ryan is playing a key role in that evolution.”

Chief investment officer Jon Maier and head of finance Ronnie Riven are both stepping down, The Wall Street Journal recently reported. Since November, the New York-based company lost chief executive Luis Berruga, chief operating officer John Belanger, head of human resources Crystal Christy and Bruno Stein, who led operations in Brazil, The Journal said.
Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas questioned whether executives are being forced out or leaving on their own.
“They’re losing all of their ETF people,” Balchunas said in an interview. “I don’t know anyone there anymore, and that’s bad because I get around. They don’t pitch stories or even send out press releases anymore.”
Global X, which brought on Ryan O'Connor as its new CEO on April 8, emailed a statement in response to a request for comment that reads in part, “Recent statements made about Global X are baseless and without merit. When we parted ways with the former CEO, we knew there would be additional changes and we expect more to come as we position ourselves for the future.”
“Ryan’s nearly two decades of industry experience and direct role in innovative product development weighed heavily in our decision to appoint him as CEO,” the statement continued.
In January, Global X closed 19 ETFs, cutting its total lineup to 90. The closed funds were small and included a mixture of strategies focused on China, Pakistan, healthcare, real estate and cannabis.
Trimming unprofitable ETFs from a lineup is common across the industry. Still, at the end of January Global X withdrew its application with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot bitcoin ETF, just weeks after 11 such funds had been approved and went on to pull in billions in inflows.
A company spokesperson emailed at the time that a spot bitcoin ETF “is not a current priority for the business.”

SPY,2024-10-05,Can lower rates save the economy? BCA weighs in,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lower-rates-save-economy-bca-084000621.html,"Investing.com -- In a note Monday, BCA Research analysts examined the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's recent 50-basis point rate cut on the economy, particularly regarding consumer spending and household borrowing.
In light of revised data on household income and spending, they propose that lower interest rates might help stimulate a rebound in borrowing, thereby supporting consumer spending and possibly preventing a recession.
Despite the optimistic outlook, the analysts caution that ""household balance sheets have the capacity to lever up.""
However, they emphasize that mortgages constitute the largest segment of household debt, and it may take considerable time for mortgage rates to decline sufficiently to invigorate housing activity. The firm believes the lag could hinder immediate benefits from the rate cuts.
BCA Research encourages the monitoring of specific household debt and housing market indicators in the coming months that could potentially challenge their current recessionary outlook.
They are specifically interested in signs that could indicate a shift in economic conditions, which may affect their predictions and investment strategies.
Despite these considerations, the analysts remain cautious. They state, ""We don't yet see sufficient evidence to deviate from our US recession call and portfolio positioning,"" which currently emphasizes long-duration investments, curve steepeners, and an underweight stance on spread products.
BCA continues to add to its list of indicators to monitor, signaling an openness to adjusting its views if economic conditions evolve.
While lower rates could theoretically stimulate borrowing and spending, BCA Research is not yet convinced that these measures will significantly alter the economic trajectory.

SPY,2024-10-04,"US jobs report crushes expectations as economy adds 254,000 jobs, unemployment rate falls to 4.1%",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-jobs-report-crushes-expectations-as-economy-adds-254000-jobs-unemployment-rate-falls-to-41-131017848.html,"The US labor market added far more jobs than projected in September while the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked lower, reflecting a stronger picture of the jobs market than Wall Street had expected.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the labor market added 254,000 payrolls in September, more additions than the 150,000 expected by economists.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, from 4.2% in August. September job additions came in higher than the revised 159,000 added in August. Revisions to both the July and August report showed the US economy added 72,000 more jobs during those two months than previously reported.
Wage growth, an important measure for gauging inflation pressures, rose to 4% year over year, from a 3.9% annual gain in August. On a monthly basis, wages increased 0.4%, in line with August's reading.
The key question entering Friday's report was whether the data would reflect significant cooling in the labor market, which could prompt another large Fed interest rate cut. Robert Sockin, Citi senior global economist, told Yahoo Finance that the better-than-expected jobs report makes it less likely the Fed moves with the ""urgency"" it did at its September meeting when the central bank cut interest rates by half a percentage point.
""This pushes the Fed out a lot,"" he said, adding that it's uncertain the Fed will make a 50 basis point cut again this year.

Following the report, markets were pricing in a roughly 5% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by half a percentage point in November, down from a 53% chance seen a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.
""Looking at the labour market strength evident in September’s employment report, the real debate at the Fed should be about whether to loosen monetary policy at all,"" Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""Any hopes of a [50 basis point] cut are long gone.""
Futures tied to major US stock indexes rallied on the news. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) put on nearly 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) added roughly 0.5%. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) moved 1.1% higher.
Renaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note following the release that September's jobs report was ""undeniably good news"" for the equity market.
""At the end of the day, the Fed is still cutting policy rates even as the economy grows,"" Dutta wrote.

SPY,2024-10-03,Why Gen Z bets big while boomers play it safe: A generational breakdown of market returns,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gen-z-bets-big-while-boomers-play-it-safe-a-generational-breakdown-of-market-returns-163139081.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
It's a Goldilocks moment for investors.
As the books are closed on September, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has delivered a solid 20% return so far this year. Meanwhile, bonds are up a respectable 4.7%. And cash is yielding a similar percentage return — even after the Fed began cutting rates a few weeks ago.
But new research from Jack Manley at JPMorgan Asset Management uncovers hidden pitfalls, particularly for those entering their investment years during periods of high cash yields (much like the present). His findings suggest that all investors, regardless of generation, are heavily shaped by the market environment they grew up in.
Manley's methodology, rooted in demographic and behavioral analysis, assumes individuals begin investing 20 years after their generation's inception. For example, baby boomers started investing around 1966, Gen X in 1985, millennials in 2001, and Gen Z in 2017.
Source: FactSet, Robert Shiller, JPMorgan Asset Management. *Investment periods begin 20 years after each generation's inception based on the assumption that people have access to investable capital at this age. Investment periods begin in the following years: Baby Boomer (1966), Generation X (1985), Millennials (2001), Generation Z (2017). Annualized total returns are calculated using monthly data as of March 31, 2024. Data are as of June 30, 2024.
Over the decades, boomers have weathered all sorts of market turmoil, from the inflation crises of the 1970s to multiple tech booms later in life. With average annual stock returns around 10.2% and bond returns of 6.2%, their experience reflects a period of high growth and volatility.
As Manley explained in an episode of Stocks in Translation, “the Fed paid pathological attention” to the inflation crisis, and the entire experience had a profound effect in shaping boomers' cautious and diversified approach to investing — despite the strong returns.
For Generation X, the journey has been one of boom-bust cycles. But the older cohort of this group largely began investing amid a secular boom in markets. Entering adulthood during the 1980s, they witnessed the rise of tech but also faced brutal recessions, from the dot-com bubble to the 2008 financial crisis.
With returns hovering around 11.6% for stocks, their approach is cautious but optimistic. As Manley noted about the current market environment, “strong balance sheets are very important right now.” This may resonate with Gen X’s preference for financial resilience in uncertain times.
Millennials are the most educated generation, as measured by the percentage with bachelor's degrees or higher. But they have not fared as well in stock market returns, averaging around 8.0%, according to Manley.
When millennials came of investing age in 2001, the S&P 500 peaked, ushering in the dot-com bust. After stocks roared back amid a housing boom, the global financial crisis created a double top in the benchmark in 2007 that would not be eclipsed until 2013 — leaving millennial investors underwater for a dozen years.

Risk markets are off to an ominous start this October.
After a blistering rally over the first nine months that led the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to its best performance since 1997, the benchmark just had its worst day in three weeks on Tuesday.
Geopolitical tensions and an Iranian missile strike on Israel are dominating headlines, pushing crude oil prices higher as fears of supply disruptions escalate. The first strike by the International Longshoremen's Association since 1977 — threatening supply chains once again and potentially shuttering ports from Houston to Boston — isn't helping.
But there’s another key driver adding structural bullishness to commodities: China’s largest stimulus package since the pandemic, with the promise of more to come.

Last week, China unleashed a suite of monetary and fiscal easing measures, catapulting China's benchmark CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) 27% from its September lows into fresh bull market territory.
New support for China's beleaguered housing market this week adds to prior measures — including support for Chinese-listed stocks — which all told now total over $500 billion (though estimates vary widely).
These aggressive actions are already reverberating through global commodity markets. Iron ore futures have surged over 20% in China, leading Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, to weigh in on X:
""The Chinese finally stimulating domestic demand gives hope that they will start to consume more. This idea is significantly contributing to this unfolding rally in industrial metals.""
Connecting the dots, it's a short trip to higher energy prices. As Bianco notes, ""The Chinese consume more energy than the US or the EU.""
Institutional investors have been caught flat-footed all around. According to the BofA September Global Fund Manager Survey, China's growth expectations had fallen to a record low. Any shorts have likely been sent scrambling.
Meanwhile, WTI (WTI) and Brent (BZ=F) crude oil are surging with Iran's missile attack on Israel, with the former jumping nearly 8% Tuesday.

The four largest funds by assets under management (AUM), the equities-tracking $590 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the $527 billion Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), $440 billion Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), the $527 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), and the fixed income-targeting $119 billion Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) led the quarterly gainers.

""Speaking of records, ETFs just had their best quarter, evah,"" wrote Bloomberg Senior Analyst Eric Balchunas in an X post, adding, ""YTD flows now up to $691b with a great shot at all time record.""
ETFs Soar Along With Wider Markets
This latest surge following strong first and second quarters reflected an uptick in investor optimism about inflation and the economy and the ongoing voracious appetite for ETFs. Balchunas, who earlier this year predicted that ETFs would likely break the $1 trillion threshold, noted that inflows were already approaching $700 billion and that more than 2,000 funds ""took in cash"" in Q3.
SPY and VOO generated a combined $24 billion in inflows over the past month, according to etf.com data, with much of those increases coming after a hefty interest rate cut by the U.S. central bank that sent major indexes to multiple record highs. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq are up 3.5% and 4.5% respectively over this timeframe and have both risen roughly 20% year-to-date.
In an interview with etf.com, Balchunas linked ETFs' recent success to the recent market upturn and increasing embrace by once skeptical institutional investors. ""Markets are firing on all pistons,"" he said, adding: ""There are no holdouts.""
In Tuesday trading, SPY, VOO, VTI and IVV were all slightly in the red on concerns that tensions in the Middle East would escalate after Iran fired a barrage of missiles toward Israel. The attack followed Israel's assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the long-time leader of Iran proxy Hezbollah. BOND inched upward as investors sought refuge in tradition risk-off assets.

SPY,2024-10-01,Here's how AI is set to disrupt healthcare — albeit slowly,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
The third quarter just wrapped, and the pure AI trade of Nvidia (NVDA) and its chip cohorts suddenly finds itself a net drag on overall S&P 500 performance — which itself surprised investors with a solid 5.5% return.
Nevertheless, generative AI is still hot and slowly moving into real-world applications.
Abby Yoder, US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, highlighted that healthcare, which is notoriously slow-moving, may be an upcoming candidate for AI-driven innovation.
""Healthcare has underperformed seven of the last eight years,"" Yoder pointed out in a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, despite the sector being the only one in the S&P 500 to boast positive annual earnings growth over the past 21 years.
But Yoder sees AI as a potential key to unlock a long-awaited shake-up that could bring long-term growth back to the sector.
Healthcare stocks have struggled in recent years, a trend Yoder attributes to legacy constraints of old systems and obstacles that make it difficult for new technologies to take root. The byzantine web of players, rules, regulators, and more has so far prevented significant AI adoption, which has the potential to address inefficiencies in insurance approvals, manual record-keeping, and claims management, all of which drag on productivity.

There are some ripples of change, however. Companies like Google and Microsoft are diving into this space, partnering with hospitals and startups to create AI tools that lighten this burden.
On the diagnostic side, AI is being used to streamline medical imaging, cutting down time for tasks like identifying patterns in medical data, which improves both speed and accuracy in patient care. The goal is not to rid the world of human radiologists and technicians, but empower them with 21st-century tools that lighten their load and accelerate patient diagnoses and recoveries.
AI proponents say it's not just about cutting costs; it’s about revolutionizing patient care. By using vast datasets of clinical information, the promise of AI is to someday help predict patient outcomes more effectively, modeling care before it happens to anticipate complications and select treatments.
The other great hope for medical AI bulls is the immense promise for drug discovery.
According to Morgan Stanley's healthcare forecast, the company's head of US biopharma research Terence Flynn estimates that “[every] 2.5% improvement in preclinical development success rates could lead to an additional 30-plus new drug approvals over 10 years,"" which would represent around $70 billion.

SPY,2024-10-01,The S&P 500 is too tech-heavy. This alternative ETF keeps beating it.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-too-tech-heavy-160100786.html,"Investors love index funds with good reason. They allow for easy diversification and typically feature low expenses. For patient investors, broad index funds might perform better than most actively managed funds because that management is more expensive and because it is so difficult to select index-beating portfolios consistently.
But with the S&P 500 SPX having returned 36.4% over the past year through Sept. 30, warnings to investors typically center on two subjects.
Most Read from MarketWatch
‘I’m overwhelmed’: I inherited $185,000. With the Fed lowering rates, should I park it in 5% CDs or high-yield savings accounts? 
‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off?
The S&P 500 is too tech-heavy. This alternative ETF keeps beating it.
What drove Tuesday’s stock market decline? It wasn’t just about Iran.
‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust?
The first is valuation. The index trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.6, based on Monday’s closing prices and weighted consensus earnings-per-share estimates among analysts polled by FactSet. That is up from a forward P/E of 18 a year ago, and well above the 10-year average forward P/E of 18.3, according to data provided by FactSet.
The second warning is about the concentration of the large-cap U.S. benchmark index. The S&P 500 is weighted by market capitalization. On Monday, the portfolio of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the oldest and largest exchange-traded fund tracking the index, was 20% allocated to three companies: Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Nvidia Corp. NVDA. These were its top five holdings, which made up 26% of the portfolio:

SPY was established in January 1993 and has $591 billion in assets under management.
All total returns in this article include reinvested dividends and are net of expenses.
The S&P 500’s weighting by market cap rewards success, but it can also lead to an index fund’s investors having more of their money concentrated in a handful of stocks than they might realize.
Different weighting and selection within the S&P 500
One obvious way to counter a cap-weighted index is to allocate equally. Since share prices move daily, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP is rebalanced quarterly. The equal weighting leads to more of a value tilt, as the technology giants at the top of the index, with such strong sales growth for a company such as Nvidia, all have equal weighting, even to companies that are growing at a snail’s pace. This makes for differentiated performance. For example, in 2022, when SPY was down 18.2%, RSP fell only 11.6%. But when SPY roared back with a 26.2% return in 2023, RSP rose 13.7%.

SPY,2024-10-01,Investing.com Poll: What will be the outcome of Friday's US jobs report?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-com-poll-outcome-fridays-152532630.html,"Investing.com -- The latest US nonfarm payrolls report on Friday is due to highlight the economic calendar this week.
Economists expect the US economy to add 144,000 jobs in September, up slightly from 142,000 in the prior month. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, is seen matching August's level of 4.2%.
In August, payrolls rose from a heavily-downwardly revised reading of 89,000 and were below forecasts of 164,000, while the jobless rate ticked down from 4.3%. As a whole, the numbers indicated a downshift in labor demand -- a trend identified by several Federal Reserve officials as a key driving force behind their decision to announce a jumbo 50-basis point interest rate reduction last month.
Analysts at ING argued in a note to clients that the jobs market continues to hold ""the key to the pace"" of upcoming potential interest rate cuts, particularly as inflation -- once the major focus of a series of aggressive Fed borrowing cost hikes -- shows signs of abating.
""If we get the unemployment rate rising back to 4.3% next Friday and a sub 75,000 payrolls print expect the calls for a second 50 [basis point] rate cut to grow markedly,"" the ING analysts said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Monday that the central bank would likely opt for more traditional quarter-point interest rate cuts moving forward, but stressed that the future path of borrowing costs is not on a preset course.
Powell added that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is not ""in a hurry to cut rates quickly"" despite announcing the outsized drawdown at its Sept. 17-18 gathering. He defended the decision, saying it reflected the FOMC's ""growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2%.""
On Tuesday, US job openings unexpectedly increased slightly in August, potentially indicating some resilience in cooling labor demand in the third quarter.
The closely-monitored Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that available positions, a proxy for labor demand, rose to 8.040 million on the final business day of August, climbing from an upwardly-revised tally of 7.711 million in July. Economists had predicted the so-called JOLTS report would dip marginally to 7.640 million.
In July, the figure slipped to its lowest mark in three-and-a-half years, which was seen as a possible sign that the US jobs market was losing steam -- albeit in an orderly fashion.

SPY,2024-10-01,S&P 500 Logs Best Quarter Since Q4 2021: 5 Top Stocks in ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-logs-best-quarter-141000364.html,"Amid huge volatility and uncertainty, the S&P 500 emerged stronger in the third quarter, touching a series of new record highs. The broad market index wrapped up its best quarter since the fourth quarter of 2021, rising 5.5%, and recorded its best year-to-date performance at September end since 1997. The S&P 500 also notched its best September since 2013 and the fifth consecutive month of increase. 

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, gained 5.5% in the third quarter. While many stocks powered the ETF, we have highlighted five that led the portfolio. These stocks have a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These are Mohawk Industries Inc. MHK, Kellanova K, CBRE Group Inc. CBRE, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. SWK and PulteGroup Inc. PHM. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

While recession fears, geopolitical tensions, the fading AI craze, and looming elections led to some of the worst declines in July and August, rate-cut optimism buoyed the stock market. Investors shunned technology stocks in favor of smaller companies and other sectors, which are bigger beneficiaries of Fed rate cuts. 

The Federal Reserve kicked off the easing monetary era last month by slashing key interest rates by 50 bps to 4.75%-5% after holding it at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence in the fact that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level. 

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of another 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and 50-bps in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026 (read: Fed Initiates Rate Cuts: Top-Ranked Growth ETFs to Buy). 

Lower rates lead to reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer and business loans. This helps businesses to expand their operations more easily, resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, stimulates economic growth and boosts the stock market. 

Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.
SPY in Focus
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each. 

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $585.5 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 46 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).

Below, we have highlighted the abovementioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.

SPY,2024-09-30,Equal Weight ETFs Record Over $2B in September Inflows,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equal-weight-etfs-record-over-120000297.html,"Equal weight ETFs have pulled in over $2 billion in inflows in September as investors seek out more balanced exposure amid persistent market volatility.
The $3.6 billion iShares S&P 500 Equal Weight UCITS ETF (ISPE) received $1.2 billion in inflows over the month, while the $6.5bn Xtrackers S&P 500 Equal Weight UCITS ETF (XDEW) gained $750 million of net new assets, according to data from ETFbook.
Meanwhile, the Xtrackers $1.4 billion S&P 500 Equal Weight ESG UCITS ETF (XZEW) pulled in $560 million.
Equal Weight S&P 500 ETF Benefits
The diversification benefits of equally weighted ETFs continue to appeal to investors as market volatility is expected to persist, particularly in light of the looming U.S. elections in November and ongoing geopolitical tensions. The S&P 500 was trading near its all-time closing high (its 42nd record of the year), set on Thursday. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) was trading slightly down on Friday afternoon, along with other major S&P-tracking funds.
etf,com
Investors have been buoyed by recent data showing sustained decreases in inflation and solid economic growth, but they remain wary about the prospects of recession.
Equally weighted strategies help to mitigate concentration risks from ‘magnificent 7’ stocks, which make up over a third of the S&P 500.
Other ETF Strategies to Diversify Portfolios
Other strategies have also been pursued to avoid overconcentration risks. They include Xtrackers MSCI World ex USA UCITS ETF (EXUS), which debuted in March, and allows investors to separate their U.S. equity allocations.
Speaking at ETF Stream’s ETF Ecosystem Unwrapped in May, Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at Cambridge Judge Business School, called the strategy “an appallingly bad idea” as they “sell the winners and buy the losers” to get back to equal weight.
Invesco recently introduced Europe’s first ETF providing equal weight exposure to the popular MSCI World index, bringing its equally weighted range to three.

All eyes on labor
The most recent reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continue to cool toward the Fed's 2% goal, putting further focus on the Fed's other mandate: maximum employment.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference on Sept. 18 that the labor market is currently in ""solid condition"" and the central bank is cutting interest rates, in part, to keep it that way.
Still, there's been a clear slowdown in the labor market. The unemployment rate has steadily crept up in 2024 and sits at 4.2%, near its highest level in almost three years. Meanwhile, job gains have slowed, with the US economy recording two of its lowest monthly job additions of 2024. And job openings in July were at their lowest level since January 2021.
The pressing question as the release of the September jobs report on Friday morning approaches is just how quickly this slowdown in the labor market is taking place.
Consensus expectations on Wall Street point to more signs of a gradual cooling rather than a rapid slowdown. The September jobs report is expected to show 130,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.2%, according to data from Bloomberg. In August, the US economy added 142,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.2%.
Entering the labor market data dump, the most recent print on weekly jobless claims showed weekly unemployment claims were at a four-month low for the week ending Sept. 21.
Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients Friday that the consistently low layoff numbers suggest that ""September employment report should be decent.""
""The labor market is the biggest risk to our outlook,"" Bhave wrote. ""Layoffs are the key indicator to watch: as long as they stay low, the base case will likely remain a soft landing.""

SPY,2024-09-28,"Fed rate cuts increase odds of 90s-style stock market meltup, Yardeni says",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-rate-cuts-increase-odds-094000326.html,"Investing.com -- Recent actions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), particularly the decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points, have triggered debate about their broader economic implications.
Yardeni Research offers a pointed observation: the current environment resembles the conditions that led to a stock market ""meltup"" in the 1990s.
A meltup refers to a sharp and unsustainable rise in asset prices driven more by a surge in investor sentiment than by improving fundamentals.
Yardeni’s comparison to the 1990s is significant. During that period, the U.S. economy experienced low inflation and robust economic growth, creating an environment in which asset prices, particularly stocks, soared.
A combination of factors, including aggressive monetary easing, low interest rates, and technological advancements, resulted in a prolonged bull market.
However, this surge in stock prices, particularly in the tech sector, led to a bubble, which burst in the early 2000s.
Yardeni suggests that the recent rate cuts, despite an already strong economy, set the stage for a similar trajectory.
The stock market has already demonstrated signs of frothy valuations, and further easing could accelerate those trends.
By removing recessionary risks, the Fed's policy encourages more liquidity in the market, fueling a potential stock market rally driven by investor exuberance rather than solid economic fundamentals.
The decision to cut rates when unemployment is low and growth is solid carries inherent risks. According to Yardeni, the FOMC’s move could stimulate an economy that does not need further boosting. This policy could push asset prices into overvaluation territory, stretching valuations and increasing macroeconomic volatility.
“Hence, we raised our subjective probability for a 1990s-style stock market meltup from 20% to 30% last week,” the analysts said.
In the 1990s, the market's meltup culminated in the dot-com bubble. Yardeni implies that a similar pattern could emerge if investors' risk-taking is emboldened by low rates.
The surge in liquidity could lead to excessive speculation, particularly in technology and growth stocks, where valuations are already stretched.
FOMC Chair Jerome Powell’s decision to lower rates, Yardeni suggests, is likely motivated by a desire to prevent unemployment from rising significantly, especially after a period of high inflation.
However, this choice to prioritize avoiding recession risks may increase the chances of overheating.
Yardeni points out that Powell’s decision seems to avoid short-term economic pain at the cost of long-term stability, which could mirror the Fed’s approach in the 1990s.

SPY,2024-09-27,"U.S. ETFs Hit $10T in Assets on Market Gains, Inflows",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-etfs-hit-10t-assets-180727532.html,"U.S. ETFs have reached a milestone $10 trillion in assets according to Bloomberg data, thanks to a mix of market gains, stealing share from mutual funds and investors pouring money across the board into stock, bond, commodity and alternative funds.
ETFs have pulled in $691 billion so far this year, Bloomberg reported. Those inflows are amplified by gains in stocks, with indexes notching multiple record highs over the year as interest rates were cut and investors bet on a soft landing in the economy.
The investments have been surging since the first ETF was issued just over 30 years ago. The pace of growth has only accelerated, as assets hit $1 trillion 14 years ago, Bloomberg said. Investors use the products in a variety of manners, from hedges to capturing growth in overseas markets to getting exposure to spot cryptocurrency markets, a category introduced this year that holds around $60 billion in assets.
Assets will reach $25 trillion in the next decade, Bloomberg ETF Senior Analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted. ""Normally they double assets every 5yrs but this time it only took 3.7yrs.""
Also helping the industry: Just shy of 500 of new funds have opened this year, giving investors access to a range of options from broad indexes to specialized, niche areas, including leveraged stock ETFs. At the same time, about 140 funds have closed.
Market Gains
Investors have increasingly returned to stocks this year, pulling cash from money markets as the Fed came through with interest rate cuts and pushing equities higher. The $583 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the first and largest ETF tracks the top 500 publicly traded companies in the U.S. and has gained 21% so far this year, well ahead of its average 6.8% annual increase.
etf.com
While SPY has actually had outflows this year, the No. 2 ETF, the $543.2 billion Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has drawn in $45.2 billion. Those two funds account for more than 10% of the ETF market.
Fixed income has also had big asset growth, with the 10 pulling in around $57 billion, according to etf.com data.
The transfer of investments into exchange-traded funds from mutual funds is boosting the industry. Through August, mutual funds had net outflows of $217 billion while ETFs raked in billions, Morningstar recently said.
Globally, ETF assets reached $14 trillion, thanks to net inflows of $1.45 trillion so far this year, according to U.K.-based ETFGI. They started the year at $11.6 trillion for a 21% gain, according to ETFGI founder Deb Fuhr, who is also a member of etf.com's editorial board.

SPY,2024-09-27,4 ETFs Yielding 7% or More & Outperforming S&P 500,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-etfs-yielding-7-more-122900004.html,"Wall Street received good news this month in the form of a Fed rate cut. The Fed enacted a 50-bp rate cut but the move was insufficient to keep the broader market rallying. Although U.S. stocks hit highs initially, they wavered occasionally this week. Investors expressed doubts over the health of the economy and the chances of another solid rate cut.
Meanwhile, consumer confidence fell in September as Americans grew increasingly worried about a cooling labor market. The latest index reading from the Conference Board was 98.7, below the 105.6 seen in August and lower than what the 104 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. The drop in consumer confidence from August to September was the largest decline since August 2021, according to the Conference Board.
Moreover, new home sales declined in August following an increase in the prior month as still-high mortgage rates as well as high prices kept buyers from entering the housing market. Also, some investors continue to fear that the huge AI investments made by big tech companies would pay off later than expected.
The scale of profitability of those investments is also unknown now, while the high valuation of the AI stocks is a concern for many investors. Meanwhile, the Fed rate cut and the resultant decline in bond yields should boost the demand for high-income assets.
 Time for High Dividend ETFs?
 High-dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide investors with avenues to make up for capital losses if that happens at all. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few of the dividend ETFs that yield more than 5% currently.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY added 1.7% past month (as of Sept. 25, 2024). Some of these dividend ETFs outperformed SPY ETF in the past month.
High Dividend ETFs in Focus
Global X SuperDividend ETF SDIV – Yields 10.46%; Up 4.81% Past Month
The underlying Solactive Global SuperDividend Index tracks the performance of 100 equally weighted companies that rank among the highest dividend-yielding equity securities in the world. The index provider applies certain dividend stability filters. The fund charges 58 bps in fees and yields 10.46% annually (as of Sept. 25, 2024).
Hoya Capital High Dividend Yield ETF RIET – Yields 9.15%; Up 5.31% Past Month
The underlying Hoya Capital High Dividend Yield Index is a rules-based index that is designed to provide diversified exposure to 100 U.S.-listed real estate-related securities that collectively provide income through high dividend yields. The fund charges 50 bps in fees and yields 9.15% annually.

TSLL,2024-06-05,Direxion META Single-Stock ETFs Wrap Mag-7 Lineup,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/direxion-meta-single-stock-etfs-205126659.html,"Direxion, which manages more than $40.1 billion in 85 ETFs, launched a pair of funds that offer leveraged long and short exposure to Meta Platforms Inc., filling out its Magnificent Seven single-stock lineup.
The Direxion Daily META Bull 2X Shares ETF (METU) and the Direxion META Bear 1X Shares ETF (METD) complete Direxion’s Mag Seven single-stock ETF lineup that was initiated in August 2022 with exchange-traded funds offering levered and short exposure to Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. New York-based Direxion added single-stock ETF exposure to Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.  in September 2022 and Nvidia Corp. a year later.
The deliberate pace of the rollout, which began shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission started allowing single-stock ETFs, was pegged to anticipated investor appetite, according to Ed Egilinsky, managing director at New York-based Direxion.
“We wanted to see how the single-stock ETFs would be received, and we thought some of the other single stocks might be more readily traded,” he said.
Direxion's Full Slate of Mag Seven ETFs
Because the single-stock ETFs make long or short bets and the price resets daily, share price volatility is an important factor for attracting active investors and day traders.
“Single-stock ETFs have exploded in popularity recently,” said etf.com Senior ETF Analyst Sumit Roy, who cited the success of the GraniteShares 2X Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which has grown to $3 billion.
Another example of appeal in the category is the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares ETF (TSLL) at $1 billion.
“These are numbers that a lot of people wouldn't have believed when single-stock ETFs launched less than two years ago,” Roy added.
The leverage on six Mag Seven single-stock ETFs that Direxion launched prior to the META versions were each changed from 1.5 times leverage to 2 times leverage in April to reach the maximum allowed leverage for single-stock ETFs.
Across Direxion’s ETF lineup, Egilinsky said three of the top 10 funds in terms of inflows this year are single-stock ETFs.
As trading vehicles, the levered and inverse ETFs can see wild moves in terms of inflows and outflows, Egilinsky said.
“With the market rallying we’ve seen some top inflows in our bear products,” he said.

TSLL,2024-04-29,TSLL Surges 86%. Will it Keep Rallying?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsll-surges-86-keep-rallying-200403355.html,"Shares of Tesla Inc. soared 18% on Monday, adding to their massive gains from last week and boosting exchange-traded funds holding the company's stock, as the electric vehicle maker's robotaxi ambitions advanced.
From its low point a week ago, the stock has jumped over 39%, fueling a whopping 86% return for the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (TSLL) over that same time frame. After Monday’s surge, TSLL has over $1 billion in assets under management for the first time since December, despite falling  as low as $557 million last week. The fund had pulled in $114.1 million this month before Friday's $30.8 million in outflows.
China's giving Tesla approval to sell its driver-assistance system sparked Monday’s rally.
Known as Full Self-Driving, or FSD, in the U.S., sales of the system could help arrest the steep slowdown in revenues that Tesla has seen this year (the system costs $8,000 up front or $99 per month in the U.S).
It would also be a step towards Tesla’s larger goal of rolling out fully autonomous taxis around the world.
China and Robotaxis
In April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that he would unveil his company’s robotaxi on Aug. 8. That announcement, combined with today’s news of a potential FSD rollout in China, has investors excited about the prospect that Tesla could become more than just an electric vehicle manufacturer.
On the other hand, many Tesla owners say that while it’s made a lot of advancements over the past year, FSD is far from the type of system that could make vehicles truly autonomous.
That raises questions about what Tesla will unveil in August. If the roboxtaxi reveal fails to impress, the stock could quickly retreat back towards last week’s lows.
A steady stream of good news and notable progress towards Tesla’s bold, self-driving future is likely required to offset slowing sales of Tesla’s vehicles and keep the stock rallying.

TSLL,2024-04-24,Tesla ETFs Soar on Musk’s Futuristic Vision,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-etfs-soar-musk-futuristic-201513083.html,"Amazing words, horrible numbers. That’s the way a lot of people characterized Tesla’s latest earnings report and conference call.
On Wednesday, the words won out as investors sent shares of the world’s largest electric vehicle maker up by 14%, its biggest gain since 2021.
That, in turn, sent the $750 million Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (TSLL) higher by a whopping 28%.
Even the $19 billion Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) gained 1.4%, an outperformance versus the flat S&P 500. The ETF holds over 11% of its portfolio in Tesla stock.
Notably Lower Growth
Tesla’s earnings report confirmed everything investors feared about the company’s financials in the first quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.45, a decline of 47% compared to the year ago period. Revenues of $21.3 billion fell by 8.7%. And the company burned $2.5 billion of cash in the quarter.
These financial metrics are unlikely to improve imminently, according to the firm.
“In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023,” the company wrote in its Q1 shareholder update.
But investors didn’t care. The slowdown in Tesla’s growth this year was already well known to investors; it’s the reason the stock plunged 42% from the start of the year through Tuesday.
A Futuristic Vision
Instead, investors focused on Tesla’s cost-cutting measures, which have included layoffs of 2,700 employees at its Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, and the highly optimistic, futuristic vision for Tesla that CEO Elon Musk described in his conference call remarks.
Musk promised that the company would soon operate millions of autonomous vehicles, which he called “Cybercabs.” It would also begin selling its humanoid robot, Optimus, as soon as 2025.
Musk has a history of making bold promises that take much longer to come to fruition than he initially predicts. But he also has a reputation of delivering on many of his promises eventually.
It wasn’t just robots and autonomous cars that made Tesla investors so happy on Wednesday. The company said that it would “accelerate the launch of new vehicle models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025.”
“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up,” the company said.
That assuaged some investors’ concerns that Tesla’s vehicle line-up was getting stale, while opening the possibility that growth could reaccelerate next year.

TSLL,2024-04-22,Tesla ETFs Plunge Ahead of Key Earnings Report,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-etfs-plunge-ahead-key-202939958.html,"Tesla shares plunged on Monday ahead of what’s expected to be a disappointing earnings report later this week.
The electric vehicle company is the worst-performing member of the Magnificent Seven this year, with a loss of 42%.
That’s pressured exchange-traded funds with big weightings in the stock, such as the Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF (PP) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY), which hold 18.3% and 13.5% of their portfolios, respectively, in Tesla.
PP and XLY are each down around 5% year-to-date, a sharp underperformance versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which is up by the same amount.
Tesla stock has been sinking for much of this year as demand for electric vehicles has slowed. EV makers have been engaging in a fierce price war to maintain their market share.
Tesla Deliveries Sink
On April 2, Tesla reported that it delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter, a decline of 8.5% compared to the same period last year, and much lower than the 457,000 vehicles that analysts were expecting.
Tuesday after the closing bell, Tesla will report how those weak delivery numbers affected the company’s profits—and the news isn’t expected to get any better.
Analysts estimate that Tesla will report earnings per share of $0.52 for Q1, well below the $0.82 they expected at the start of the year and a decline versus the $0.85 in earnings the firm generated in the first quarter of last year.
Gross margin is expected to fall below the fourth quarter’s 17.6%, reflecting the company’s aggressive price cuts.
“The focus on Tesla’s earnings will be on further slowing sales volume and the impact of lowering prices to stimulate sales. Another area to watch will be their guidance regarding potential further margin compression from price cuts,” said Ed Egilinsky, managing director at Direxion.
Leveraged Bets
Direxion manages the $600 million Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (TSLL), the largest single-stock ETF tied to Tesla.
Shares of the ETF are down nearly 65% this year, but judging by its $330 million of inflows in 2024, many traders are betting on a rebound.
Tesla may have to clear the low bar set for this week’s earnings report for those bets to pay off in the short term.

URTY,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

URTY,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

URTY,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

URTY,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

URTY,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

URTY,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

URTY,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

URTY,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

URTY,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

URTY,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

URTY,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

Video Transcript
JOSH LIPTON: Some of the top trades of this year involve the Magnificent Seven. And Bank of America says they could be the top names to watch next year, too, but not in the way you might think. Madison Mills is here with the details.
MADISON MILLS: Well, it's exactly what you were sort of just talking about with these high valuations, right, some of these big names like a Hartnett from B of A are talking about looking outside of the Magnificent Seven but to some names that are tech adjacent, right? So he specifically talks about going long on distressed tech. If you look at the S&P biotech ETF for example, ticker XBI, he says that this example here tends to move opposite to rates, so that could be attractive as we are anticipating those rate cuts moving forward.
We're also seeing low valuations in some of those biotech names, which, obviously, is in very stark contrast to the valuations we're seeing in those top seven names that we talk about all the time. But I do want to contextualize this call from Hartnett, because those seven S&P 500 top names, they're gaining 71% this year. The other 493 stocks adding only 6% to the overall index. So I guess if you want to make an argument for more of a bull market next year, you kind of have to believe that some of these other tech names are going to grow.
JULIE HYMAN: OK. So you mentioned biotech, is there anything else that he sort of Zooms in on as potentially being winners here?
MADISON MILLS: He talks about investment-grade bonds for some of these tech Companies he says it's a way for you to own the balance sheet of those companies, rather than just owning the stock itself. And also talks about it as a potential hedge against any sort of hard landing. It's a different way to get in on the tech play.
He also talks about a blend of bond investment. He's bullish on 30-year Treasury bonds mixed with investment-grade bonds. So I thought that was interesting. It also raised this question to me of whether this stock-bond portfolio relationship that we always talk about is starting to shift a little bit with the 60/40 portfolio.

- It's time now for this week's Options Pit sponsored by Tastytrade. We're looking at what you should consider after the S&P 500 had best week of the year last week. Jared Blikre is here with Chris Brecher, Simpler Trading senior managing director of stocks. Jared.
JARED BLIKRE: Chris, thank you for being here. Let's go to the Yi-Fi Interactive, where I have one of the charts that you've given to us. This is the S&P 500 going back to March of this year. We also have the 200-day moving average, which the market is now just above. We've also had this huge run up and we're seeing the MACD into extended territory to the upside. What are you seeing in the market right now, and how would you express your views through the options market?
CHRIS BRECHER: Well, the first thing, if it wasn't holiday time, I'd be all over shorting the market, or at least looking for an hourly reversal to just buy puts. But because of this time of year when you're overbought at the 200, I'm going to look a lot more at like an SPX butterfly under the market. So I'm looking at-- and the reason I'm doing that instead of buying premium is I just-- it drives me nuts buying premium, and if you're right, but it goes down slowly, especially at this time of year.
So I would rather do something like the 4400, 4200, 4000 put fly for like March. So that way, if the market just sits here because on the one side, you have the bonds going down, which is bad for the markets in the long run, you have the overbought, which is bad for the markets just short term, but you have holiday that might keep it elevated. So I think that's a cool way to play a downside or a drift.
JARED BLIKRE: I hear you about the options market, especially buying premium. Let me move on to another market here. This is Biotech, and here we have the S&P Biotech ETF XBI believe this moving averages at 50. So it's up against that, but we're actually 60% off of the highs that were created in 2021. So a little bit more of a depressed market. But again, in the MACD, we're seeing this pretty rapid rise recently. So what are your-- what are your views on Biotech here and how would you play that?

AAPU,2024-06-05,Direxion META Single-Stock ETFs Wrap Mag-7 Lineup,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/direxion-meta-single-stock-etfs-205126659.html,"Direxion, which manages more than $40.1 billion in 85 ETFs, launched a pair of funds that offer leveraged long and short exposure to Meta Platforms Inc., filling out its Magnificent Seven single-stock lineup.
The Direxion Daily META Bull 2X Shares ETF (METU) and the Direxion META Bear 1X Shares ETF (METD) complete Direxion’s Mag Seven single-stock ETF lineup that was initiated in August 2022 with exchange-traded funds offering levered and short exposure to Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. New York-based Direxion added single-stock ETF exposure to Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.  in September 2022 and Nvidia Corp. a year later.
The deliberate pace of the rollout, which began shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission started allowing single-stock ETFs, was pegged to anticipated investor appetite, according to Ed Egilinsky, managing director at New York-based Direxion.
“We wanted to see how the single-stock ETFs would be received, and we thought some of the other single stocks might be more readily traded,” he said.
Direxion's Full Slate of Mag Seven ETFs
Because the single-stock ETFs make long or short bets and the price resets daily, share price volatility is an important factor for attracting active investors and day traders.
“Single-stock ETFs have exploded in popularity recently,” said etf.com Senior ETF Analyst Sumit Roy, who cited the success of the GraniteShares 2X Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which has grown to $3 billion.
Another example of appeal in the category is the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares ETF (TSLL) at $1 billion.
“These are numbers that a lot of people wouldn't have believed when single-stock ETFs launched less than two years ago,” Roy added.
The leverage on six Mag Seven single-stock ETFs that Direxion launched prior to the META versions were each changed from 1.5 times leverage to 2 times leverage in April to reach the maximum allowed leverage for single-stock ETFs.
Across Direxion’s ETF lineup, Egilinsky said three of the top 10 funds in terms of inflows this year are single-stock ETFs.
As trading vehicles, the levered and inverse ETFs can see wild moves in terms of inflows and outflows, Egilinsky said.
“With the market rallying we’ve seen some top inflows in our bear products,” he said.

AAPU,2024-05-03,"Apple ETFs Jump on Earnings, $110B Buyback",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-etfs-jump-earnings-110-202414482.html,"Exchange-traded funds holding Apple Inc. moved higher Friday after the iPhone maker reported first quarter results that exceeded expectations and announced a $110 billion share buyback.
Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple jumped around 7%. Apple reported it earned $1.53 per share, beating the estimate of $1.51, while revenues of $90.8 billion beat the $90.4 billion expectation.
The stock was also supported by the company's announcement that it would buy back an additional $110 billion worth of shares. That was more than the $90 billion in buybacks the company had announced in recent years.
Revenues for Apple have fallen year-over-year in five of the past six quarters, but investors were assuaged by comments from Apple that indicated growth in the low single digits for Q2.
Apple is held by 458 exchange-traded funds, including big weightings in many tech ETFs like the $63 billion Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and the $62 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which allocate over a fifth of their portfolios to the stock. The stock also has a hefty 8.5% weighting in the popular $250 billion Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). All of those funds rose today.
For aggressive traders who want more concentrated exposure to Apple, the $60 million Direxion Daily AAPL Bull 2X Shares (AAPU) offers just that. That fund jumped 13% midday Friday, twice the gain for shares of Apple.
Low Expectations
Expectations were low for Apple ahead of the release of its first quarter earnings report. The stock was down by 10% since the start of the year, sharply lagging the S&P 500’s 6.2% return.
After today’s jump, Apple’s losses have been cut to 4%.
Industry channel checks had suggested that the iPhone had lost significant market share in China.
But even though Apple’s China revenue dropped 8% from a year ago in Q1, the company attributed it to a drop in sales of other products—not the iPhone.
Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that iPhone revenues in China actually increased, which was a relief for investors.

AMZU,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

AMZU,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

AMZU,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

AMZU,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

AMZU,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

AMZU,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

AMZU,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

AMZU,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

AMZU,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

Meanwhile, Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist, breaks down the pros and cons between buying now and waiting. ""Now we're at that seasonal slowdown sweet spot for buyers. So there's less competition which can make it easier to snag a deal on a home. At the same time, you might see lower rates if you wait into the spring.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

AMZU,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

AMZU,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

AMZU,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

IEMG,2024-05-14,India Makes Case for Dominating Emerging Market ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/india-makes-case-dominating-emerging-120000406.html,"India has steadily been asserting itself as a powerhouse of emerging markets over the past few years as its government embarks on a financial and industrial overhaul.
The country’s rapid rise has been well documented. India’s GDP is expected to grow 7% in 2024, by far the fastest among the world’s largest economies, after the Reserve Bank of India revised its forecast upwards at the end of last year.
Its rise has come at a time when China’s stock has been falling. The country’s beleaguered property sector has been a symbol of its failure to bounce back from the pandemic while its tough regulatory stance on tech kept investors second-guessing.
This was reflected earlier this year when the weighting gap between Indian and Chinese equities in the MSCI Emerging Markets index fell to historic lows. India- and China-focused ETFs can be found in the etf.com screening tool. The largest U.S. emerging markets ETF is the $78.4 billion iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG).
Use the etf.com comparison tool to see how the iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA), the biggest India ETF, stacks up against the biggest China ETF, the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB).
Following the rebalance, India’s weighting grew from17.9% to 18.5% while China’s share declined to 25.4%, down from around 31% six months ago and its lowest point since 2017. A similar scenario can be seen in the countries’ bond markets.
India's Inclusion in JPMorgan Index
JPMorgan's decision to include India into its emerging market global diversified index from June 2024 is set to drive significant flows into the market, as roughly 23 bonds with a combined value of $330bn are set for inclusion.
Alberto Garcia Fuentes, head of asset allocation at ACCI Capital Investments, believes there is an investment case for both China and India, but for contrasting reasons.
“China and India are completely different stories,” he said. “China is a value play while India is growth, with the latter focusing on technology and creating new infrastructure.""
If India is Growth, China is Value
India's economic tailwinds give it momentum over China. For one, the subcontinent has just embarked on upon an election that is set to secure incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third term in office.
Also, the world's most populous country has long benefitted from political—and geopolitical—stability that has enabled it to steal a march on China.
“The rising tensions between China and the U.S. has given the Indian economy a boost,"" Stephen Kemper, chief investment strategist, team advisory desk, at BNP Paribas Wealth Management, said. ""In the wake of friend shoring, a lot of production has been shifted from China to India.

IEMG,2024-05-08,BlackRock ETF Flash Crash in Europe Explained,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-etf-flash-crash-europe-120000540.html,"BlackRock’s global ETF experienced a flash crash on Deutsche Boerse last month. How did this happen on one of Europe’s most liquid ETFs and can it be avoided in the future?
Following the US jobs data report, the $72.8 billion iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF (EUNL), Europe’s second-largest ETF, fell 5% in less than a second at 2.30pm Central European Time on April 5, before jumping back up shortly after as market-making activity resumed.
While not unprecedented – and not solely a quirk of ETFs but also other listed securities – the event highlights several key nuances in ETF trading that investors must understand.
BlackRock ETF Flash Crash Explained
Following the report of the US jobs data, sell orders were instantly placed on the ETF at a point when market-making activity was low, causing its price to decline.
This decline triggered multi-stop loss orders – a pre-placed sell order implemented by traders to limit losses on a security – causing the ETF’s price to spiral further as more and more stop loss orders were executed.
Crucially, none of these orders were big enough to trigger one of Deutsche Boerse’s safeguard mechanisms, which would have halted trading had EUNL’s price fallen 1.5%.
However, the spiral of stop-loss orders eventually triggered a separate safeguard mechanism, and trading was halted after EUNL’s price fell 5% below its overnight trading level.
Remarkably, due to the wonders of electronic trading, all of this happened in less than a second. At this point, market makers were brought back into the market to start trading on the ETF, with normal pricing resumed.
According to Paolo Giulianini, head of ETFs at Vantage Capital Markets, EUNL’s liquidity makes it more suitable for order-driven trades, meaning it can trade in a similar way to the futures and equities.
“We are talking about one of the most liquid ETFs in Europe and so it is more prone to being an order-driven ETF, not a quote-driven ETF,” he said. “If it was quote driven, you could say add more market makers, but because it is so liquid, there are likely many stop orders on this ETF which caused the price decline.”
Where Were the Market Makers?
While market makers are required to provide pricing for most of the trading day, there are often points – such as market opening or following news events – where this does not happen, or spreads are significantly wider, even on one of Europe’s most traded ETFs.
One argument is that market makers do not provide pricing during these periods of volatility as they are unlikely to profit from an arbitrage opportunity.

IEMG,2024-04-23,Investors Love This Under the Radar Emerging Markets ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-love-under-radar-emerging-120000279.html,"The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF (EMXC) has quietly become one of the largest emerging markets exchange-traded funds.
This year, investors have pushed $3.8 billion into the ETF, the largest inflows for any emerging markets ETF by far.
That’s taken the fund’s assets under management to $12.5 billion, making it the fourth-largest U.S.-listed EM exchange-traded fund after the $74 billion iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG), the $73.7 billion Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) and the $16.6 billion iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM).
EMXC’s growth suggests that investors are interested in putting money to work in emerging markets stocks, but they don’t want to deal with the risks of China.
EMXC tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets ex China Index, giving it a much different look than broader EM funds like IEMG and VWO.
For instance, IEMG has 23% of its portfolio allocated to China, while EMXC has no positions in Chinese stocks.
Instead, EMXC’s largest geography is India, with a 25% weighting, followed by Taiwan, with 23%, and Korea, with 16%.
For IEMG, India, Taiwan and Korea have smaller weightings of 19%, 18%, and 22%, respectively.
EMXC Growing as China Faces Economic Downturn
EMXC’s growing popularity reflects the angst investors have about China. Once a darling among investors, China is now grappling with an economic downturn, a declining population, and geopolitical tensions with the West.
A perception that the Chinese government is more hostile to big businesses has also weighed on sentiment.
There is the possibility that investors are abandoning China at precisely the wrong moment.  With sentiment so negative, perhaps Chinese stocks are at or close to their lows.
Only time will tell.
But even if that’s the case, investors need to be able to sleep comfortably. And if buying emerging markets without exposure to China helps them do that, then there’s nothing wrong with that.

IEMG,2024-04-11,Yellen Warns of ‘China Shock’ as EV ETFs Languish,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yellen-warns-china-shock-ev-120000709.html,"There’s more to this week’s economic and market news than the CPI report.
While market observers sifted through Wednesday’s disappointing March Consumer Price Index, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrapped up her week-long visit to Guangzhou and Beijing.
The key takeaway for investors: Yellen’s second trip to China in nine months did not result in any shifts in either the U.S. or China’s policies regarding investment and export restrictions.
While the Biden administration has maintained Trump-era tariffs, there was no explicit threat of new sanctions.
Yellen, however, addressed concerns over a return of “China shock,” which refers to the negative impact on the U.S. economy following China's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.
In the ensuring years, Chinese exports, particularly of manufactured goods, surged to the United States and Europe.
“Now, we are seeing an increase in business investment in a number of ‘new’ industries targeted by the PRC’s industrial policy. That includes electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar,” Yellen stated in a press release.
Related ETFs are the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV), down nearly 2% year-to-date, and the TSLA Daily Bear ETF (TSLQ), up almost 40% this year, as it bets against the declining EV maker, Tesla, Inc.
China’s Impact on U.S. Inflation
China’s economy Chinese economic growth can have a mixed impact on U.S. inflation, depending on the specific circumstances. Some investment banks, like Goldman Sachs, have recently revised their forecasts upwards. In April 2024, Goldman Sachs raised its China growth projection for 2024 to 5%, citing manufacturing strength in the first quarter.
Here’s how Chinese economic growth can affect U.S. inflation:
Increased supply: A growing Chinese economy often translates to increased production of goods. This can lead to a larger supply of imported goods in the U.S., potentially putting downward pressure on prices for American consumers.
Change in commodity prices: China is a major consumer of raw materials. If its economy grows rapidly, demand for these materials might rise. However, if the increase in supply outpaces a rise in demand, it can lead to lower commodity prices, which are a key driver of inflation for many goods.
Demand surge: A strong Chinese economy can also lead to surging domestic demand for goods. This can create competition for resources with other countries, including the U.S., potentially driving up prices for both countries.
Global supply chain strain: If China's growth strains global supply chains, it can lead to bottlenecks and disruptions. This can cause shortages of goods and drive prices higher for consumers worldwide, including the U.S.

KORU,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

KORU,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

KORU,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

KORU,2024-10-02,How investors can get in on the China stock rally with ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-china-stock-rally-etfs-172514354.html,"China stocks (^HSI) have extended their rally after the People's Bank of China unveiled new stimulus measures in an effort to recover its struggling economy.
Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.
Watch the video above to hear some of Rosenbluth's ETF plays for the port strike affecting the US's East and Gulf Coasts.

KORU,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

KORU,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

KORU,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

KORU,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

KORU,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

KORU,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

KORU,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

KORU,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

KORU,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

KORU,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

NVDU,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

NVDU,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

NVDU,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

NVDU,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

NVDU,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

NVDU,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

NVDU,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

NVDU,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

NVDU,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

Matt Powers, Powers Advisory Group managing partner, discusses how to best position your portfolio in a rate-easing cycle and an election year. In a lower interest rate environment, Powers focuses on traditional defensive sectors like utilities (XLU), consumer staples XLP (XLP), and financials XLF (XLF), noting that “we still expect some short-term volatility as we enter October, which is historically the most volatile month of the year in election years.”
As mortgage rates hit a two-year low, Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero breaks down what it means for potential homebuyers as they navigate the housing market. Meanwhile, Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist, breaks down the pros and cons between buying now and waiting. ""Now we're at that seasonal slowdown sweet spot for buyers. So there's less competition which can make it easier to snag a deal on a home. At the same time, you might see lower rates if you wait into the spring. But you might have to offset those lower rates with more competition and better prices. You know, in essence, I don't think buyers can go wrong either way,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

NVDU,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

NVDU,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

NVDU,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

NVDU,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

QCLN,2024-06-05,"Clean Energy ETFs Rebound on China, U.S. Windfall",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-etfs-rebound-china-120000579.html,"Clean energy ETFs led gainers in May after major developments in both China and the U.S. boosted the sector.
China’s move to address issues within its solar industry and the recent $1.7 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. government to hydrogen developer Plug Power has buoyed the sector in recent weeks.
The surge comes as the theme has struggled in recent years. Challenges around oversupply and interest sensitivity have magnified the issue. The sector was among the worst performing in 2023.
Among the top performers was the Fidelity Clean Energy UCITS ETF (FNRG), generating returns of 15.6% over the last month and contrasting returns of -21.7% in 2023.
FNRG’s top three holdings are Vestas Wind Systems A/S (4.4%), First Solar 4.4% and Verbund AG (3.7%).
The Global X Hydrogen UCITS ETF (HYGG) also rebounded, returning 28.9% over the last month compared to -40% across 2023.
The top weighting includes U.S. hydrogen producer Bloom Energy (15%), followed by Nel ASA (12.2%) and Plug Power (11%).
Following HYGG, the VanEck Hydrogen Economy UCITS ETF (HDGB) returned 18.4% over the last month.
Clean Energy Sentiment Improving?
Sentiment surrounding clean energy ETFs may also be rallying as interest rates begin to soften after aggressive hikes in 2023 and the financing of clean energy projects accelerates in the U.S.
For example, Orsted received an investment of $680 million from JPMorgan for solar and solar storage assets last month, made possible under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which launched in 2022.
Bullishness surrounding AI also aided returns, given the technology’s heavy consumption of electricity.
For example, recent research from Goldman Sachs found that a ChatGPT query needs nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search, with the same report estimating data center power demand will grow 160% by 2030.

Great to have you here once again with us, Cinthia First and foremost, the commodities ETFs-- how much of a bid are they catching now that we're seeing some of these new all time highs or the new highs in gold?
CINTHIA MURPHY: Hi, Brad. They're finally hitting everybody's radar. I mean, as you know, people look to commodities when they're trying to hedge against inflation, when we're looking to diversify portfolios. But in the last year or so, it's been all about big tech. So people have paid very little attention to the diversifiers because everybody was trying to ride that tech wave.
And this year, that's starting to change. So we're seeing a bit under commodities, we're seeing a lot more commentary from the market experts, the analysts, about the importance of commodities and the opportunity in commodities, which has been a segment that's typically under owned in the advisory channel, it's under owned by most investors. And it's at an attractive positions right now because they're so overlooked so often, especially in the middle of a tech craze. So this has been an interesting moment for these types of investments right now.
- It's particularly interesting, especially given some of the concerns that we've had really murmuring about now, and a loud murmur, about the economy and the likelihood of a recession and where that has actually perhaps fueled some demand for assets like gold. How have you been evaluating that?

SCHD,2024-10-01,Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger to be Replaced by Rick Wurster,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-ceo-walt-bettinger-replaced-200604871.html,"Charles Schwab Corp., the fifth-largest ETF issuer, has named its next chief executive officer, current president Rick Wurster, who will step into his new role Jan. 1.
The Westlake, Texas-based financial services conglomerate announced the news Tuesday morning, describing it as “part of a multi-year succession plan” that includes the Dec. 31 retirement of current CEO Walt Bettinger.
The executive transition follows the June retirement of Bernie Clark as head of Schwab Advisor Services after more than 25 years with the company, including 15 as the head of the registered investment advisor business.
Clark was replaced by Jon Beatty, the chief operating officer of Schwab Advisor Services.
Wurster, who has been president since 2021, will retain the president title when he takes over the CEO role. And Bettinger will continue to serve as executive co-chairman of Schwab’s board of directors.
Schwab Asset Management has 31 ETFs that combine for $375 billion. Two-thirds of those ETFs are slated for share-price splits on Oct. 11 in a move aimed at driving appeal among financial advisors and retail-class investors.
Bettinger, who has been the CEO since 2008, has overseen a growth in client assets to $9.74 trillion from $1.14 trillion when he took over.
Schwab's Market Capitalization Soars
The client brokerage, banking and workplace participant accounts grew to 43.2 million from 9.3 million. And Schwab’s market capitalization has grown to approximately $119 billion from $18 billion in 2008.
Bettinger also oversaw the acquisition of rival custodian TD Ameritrade in 2020.
The company did not make anyone available for an interview for this story, but in a prepared statement, Bettinger said, “As I approach my 65th birthday in 2025, the time is right for me to transition from day-to-day duties and focus on my role as executive co-chairman of the Schwab board of directors.”
Founder and co-chair Charles R. Schwab described Bettinger’s tenure as “the most significant growth in the company’s history.”
“He has earned the right to determine his retirement as CEO,” Schwab said in a prepared statement.

ETF Share Split: What It Means
“ETF share splits are primarily about maintaining or increasing investor accessibility,” said Nate Geraci, founder of The ETF Store in Overland Park, Kans.
“The lower price handle makes it easier for advisors to deploy and manage the ETFs in portfolios, primarily for smaller dollar accounts,” he added. “It also appeals to retail investors, offering the perception of affordability.”
Ryan Jackson, senior manager research analyst at Morningstar, explained that the ETF share splits “don’t matter much for current investors.”
“They don't affect the overall value of the ETFs or create a taxable event,” he said. “It could improve the liquidity in some instances because more investors may be able to trade them, but that's a very small-scale benefit. It's mostly business as usual.”
Scwhab ETF Splits May Increase Demand
Jackson added that share splits are an easy way to potentially increase demand for Schwab’s ETFs.

SCHD,2024-08-13,Schwab Debuts First Active Fixed Income ETF (SCUS),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-debuts-first-active-fixed-200248210.html,"Schwab Asset Management, the fifth-largest ETF provider, introduced its first actively managed fixed income ETF on Tuesday, entering a competitive field dominated by established players.
The Schwab Ultra-Short Income ETF (SCUS) began trading on the NYSE Arca, targeting investors seeking income with lower risk.
With an expense ratio of 0.14%, SCUS is priced below the industry average of 0.18% for actively managed ETFs in the ultrashort bond category, according to Bloomberg data. The fund invests in investment-grade, short-term, U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities issued by U.S. and foreign issues, maintaining a portfolio duration of one year or less.
“With every product we launch, our first consideration is our clients and the portfolio building blocks they desire,” a Charles Schwab spokesperson told etf.com. “We are less focused on short-term market factors and more so on building out the core products our clients need to achieve their goals over the long term.”
Ultra-Short Duration ETFs Gain Traction
The launch comes as ultra-short ETFs have gained popularity among investors seeing cash alternatives in a rising interest rate environment. SCUS will compete with established funds like the $25 billion JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF (JPST) and the $12 billion PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF (MINT).
JPST vs MINT Performance
When asked about balancing competitive pricing with active management, the Schwab spokesperson stated, “We are focused on delivering value and [designing] our products to be amongst the lowest cost offerings.”
The new ETF is part of Schwab’s broader effort to expand its fixed income ETF lineup, an asset class that has received increased client interest. With this launch, Schwab now manages 31 ETFs with nearly $354 billion in assets, with its largest fund being the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). That ETF, which debuted in 2011 and tracks an index of 100 dividend-paying U.S. equities, has $57 billion in assets.

SCHD,2024-07-03,HDV vs. SCHD: Which Is the Better Dividend ETF?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hdv-vs-schd-better-dividend-181605317.html,"The iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:HDV) and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) are two popular dividend ETFs from blue-chip sponsors. Both are cost-effective options with low expense ratios, feature portfolios of well-known dividend stocks, and have dividend yields ranging from 3.5% to 3.7%. In this article, we’ll go over what separates these ETFs and which is the better choice for dividend investors.
What Is the HDV ETF’s Strategy?
According to iShares, HDV invests in “an index composed of relatively high dividend paying U.S. equities.”
The fund invests in “established, high-quality U.S. companies” and gives investors “access to 75 dividend-paying domestic stocks that have been screened for financial health.”
What Is the SCHD ETF’s Strategy?
Meanwhile, according to Charles Schwab, SCHD invests in an “index focused on the quality and sustainability of dividends.” SCHD “invests in stocks selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios.”
Portfolio Analysis
HDV holds 75 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 57.9% of its portfolio, so the fund is a bit concentrated. Below, you’ll find an overview of HDV’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
HDV’s top holdings feature a strong assortment of Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. An impressive nine out of HDV’s top 10 holdings receive Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher, and its four largest holdings, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) boast “Perfect 10” Smart Scores.
HDV’s holdings also collectively feature attractive valuations. According to iShares, they sport an average price-to-earnings ratio of 16.4, which is just two-thirds the valuation of the broader market, as the S&P 500 (SPX) currently trades for 24 times earnings.
Meanwhile, SCHD is a bit more diversified and a bit less concentrated than HDV. It holds 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 40% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of SCHD’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
Seven of SCHD’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores, which is a respectable total, but HDV has the edge in this area.
HDV and SCHD share a handful of top 10 holdings in common, including Verizon, Chevron, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and Coca Cola (NYSE:KO). The valuation of SCHD’s holdings is also remarkably similar to those of HDV’s, as its portfolio sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.1 (as of May 31), so both funds offer a real discount to the broader market.

SCHD,2024-05-09,JEPI vs DIVO: Active Alternatives to Dividend ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jepi-vs-divo-active-alternatives-120000355.html,"Investors love dividend ETFs and active management is on the rise.
Those two themes create a powerful match.
While investors are unlikely to fall out of love with the largest dividend exchange-traded funds, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), they have been seeking equity income alternatives.
For dividend ETF alternatives, investors are choosing active management to capture attractive yields while minimizing downside risks. A prime example is the largest actively managed ETF, the $33 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI).
JEPI holds equity linked notes and writes covered call options to provide high income while attempting to produce the same return as the S&P 500 Index with lower volatility. While this strategy tends to cap upside potential, JEPI’s price performance and yield have both outpaced bonds in the past three years.
JEPI’s popularity has driven investors to similar strategies. For example, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (DIVO) attempts to provide above-average yields with a combination of dividends and option premiums.
In a market environment of low dividend yields and increasing downside risks for equities, actively managed income ETFs like JEPI and DIVO are likely to remain popular alternatives to traditional dividend ETFs.

Breaking Down JEPI vs DIVO ETFs
Yield: JEPI has the edge here with its yield of 7.5% while DIVO’s of 4.9% still beats yield for most traditional dividend ETFs.
Performance: DIVO’s dividend equity exposure helps it win the performance battle with a year-to-date gain of nearly 7%, compared to JEPI’s gain of just over 5%. DIVO also wins the 1-year return while both ETFs have similar 3-year returns.
AUM: JEPI is the largest active ETF with $33 billion in assets under management while DIVO is smaller but still respectable at just over $3 billion.
Expense ratio: JEPI’s expenses are lower at 0.35% while DIVO’s expense ratio is 0.56%.
For a full breakdown of these equity income ETFs, see the JEPI vs DIVO ETF analysis with etf.com’s comparison tool.
Bottom Line on Covered Call ETFs
Covered call ETFs like JEPI and DIVO can be appropriate for investors seeking income and a hedge against volatility. However, they should consider the risks associated with the strategy, including market risk and counterparty risk. As with any investment, investors should carefully evaluate their investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon before investing in these funds.

SCHD,2024-05-03,Best ETFs for Beginners: The Complete Guide,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etfs-beginners-complete-guide-153000969.html,"ETFs can be smart investments for almost any kind of investor, from professional money managers to beginners. In this article, we take a deep dive into how ETFs work and cover the different types of ETFs, and then we finish with a list of the best ETFs for beginners to start building a portfolio.
What Are ETFs?
ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks. They are designed to provide investors with a way to buy and sell a diversified portfolio of assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities or other financial instruments in a single security.
Why Are ETFs Good Investments for Beginners?
ETFs are often considered good investments for beginners for several reasons:
Diversification: ETFs typically hold a basket of underlying assets, such as stocks, bonds or commodities. This diversification helps spread risk across multiple investments, reducing the impact of poor performance from a single security. For beginners, diversification can be a key strategy for managing risk.
Simplicity and accessibility: ETFs are easy to understand and easy to trade. ETFs also offer access to a wide range of asset classes and investment strategies.
Professional management: ETFs are managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of shareholders. For beginners, this means that experts are managing the portfolio, potentially reducing the need for extensive research and stock-picking skills.
Tax efficiency: Many ETFs are structured in a way that can make them tax-efficient. For example, ETFs use in-kind creation and redemption processes that can minimize capital gains distributions.
Low cost: ETFs often have lower expense ratios compared with traditional mutual funds. Lower expenses can lead to higher returns over time, which is particularly beneficial for long-term investors.
Variety of investment strategies: ETFs offer a wide range of investment strategies, including passive index tracking, active management and factor-based investing. This variety allows beginners to choose strategies that align with their investment objectives.
Low minimum investments: ETFs typically have low minimum investment requirements, which is typically the price of one share. This allows beginners to start investing with relatively small amounts of capital.
Education and resources: Many financial institutions and brokerages offer educational materials and resources to help beginners learn about ETFs and investing. This support can help individuals make informed investment decisions.

SCHD,2024-05-01,Boring Utilities ETFs Could Get Advisors Excited Soon,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boring-utilities-etfs-could-advisors-120000363.html,"If you promise not to fall asleep, I’ll explain why the epically mundane utilities sector is starting to look like a place where dividend investors can go hunting. It has been a tough stretch for dividend stocks in general, and the utilities sector in particular. The sector leader in ETF assets, the $12 billion Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), has underperformed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) by more than 25% in total over the past three years. 
That’s not as bad as it gets for utilities, but it is close. And it continues a more than 13-year trend in which XLU underperforms SPY on a three-year rolling return basis. That has been the case more than 90% of the time (using monthly returns). But if past performance were an indication of future returns, advisors would see a different disclaimer at the bottom of every fund ad, wouldn’t they?  
It wasn’t always this way. For most of the first decade of this century (2000-2009), XLU routinely outperformed SPY. At the peak of that winning streak in April 2007, XLU gained 97% in a 3-year period that ended that month, versus 41% for SPY. Investors who have not been active in the markets for more than 20 years probably would need some convincing that those are facts. They are.
Bull Case for XLU, Utilities 
So, what is the bull case for XLU, since simply expecting a laggard to magically revert to the mean is not the type of investment strategy that advisors can rely on with skeptical clients? It starts with interest rates.
Utilities are often considered a “safe haven” in the equity market, especially for big money managers with mandates to only invest in stocks. At times when the whole market is one big sea of ink, the higher dividend yield and relative stability of these companies’ business models is about the closest thing managers can get to a bond-like escape valve.  
The other interest rate related aspect of utility investing is that if the stock market starts to sniff out a situation where Treasury rates may need to come down in a panic due to the country’s heavy debt burden and recession concerns, that could also play into the hands of the sector some simply refer to as “Utes,” which brings up reminders of the University of Utah’s sports teams as well as a famous scene from the movie My Cousin Vinny. 
Utilities ETFs: Boring But Beautiful in 2024?
Utilities are regulated entities, and while there is more competition than there used to be decades ago, this is still a market sector where companies operate as near-monopolies. In economies like the US, where market forces and competition are dominant factors, the utilities sector stands out because consumers cannot simply shop around for where to get their electricity. If you live in a certain town, that provider is already in place, and utility commissions regulate the rates they can charge.

SCHD,2024-04-15,Schwab Q1 ETF Assets Jumped 7% on Rising Market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-q1-etf-assets-jumped-193454006.html,"Charles Schwab Corp., the fifth-largest ETF issuer, said first-quarter proprietary ETF assets increased by 7% over the previous period to $343 billion as asset management businesses ride a wave of strong stock market performance.
The Westlake, Texas-based financial services conglomerate, which holds $339.9 billion in 30 exchange-traded funds, reported that its ETF assets jumped 22% jump from last year's first quarter. The gains were in stride with expectations from market analysts. Total ETFs assets, including non-proprietary funds, at grew to over $2 trillion, up 10% from the previous quarter and up 28% from a year ago.
Schwab is the second major ETF issuer to report first-quarter earnings, following New York-based BlackRock Inc., which reported a 22% increase in ETF assets over the past year. Overall, Schwab reported first-quarter net revenues of $4.7 billion, reflecting a 6% increase over the prior quarter. The company reported per share earnings of 74 cents, which beat estimates by a penny.
“These are pretty positive numbers, and they continue to benefit from the market tailwinds,” said Michael Elliott, an analyst at CRFA. Elliott, who is bullish on Schwab, described the report as “positive,” thanks largely to “strong growth in asset management fees.”
Schwab stock jumped nearly 4% today and has gained 41% over the past year. Schwab shares are held in 222 ETFs, which hold 178.1 million shares. The largest allocation is the 5.3% held by the IShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI).
Schwab’s proprietary ETFs represent 17% of the $9.1 trillion in total client assets. According to the earnings report, total client assets grew by 9.6% during the first quarter and are up 28% from the first quarter last year.
Elliott said a key driver to Schwab’s financial performance is the net interest revenue totaling $2.3 billion during the quarter on an average yield of 2.02%, which is up from 1.9% during the fourth quarter but down from 2.2% a year ago.
That revenue stream, representing about half of the company’s total revenues, has been impacted by a gradual movement of money sitting in low-yielding cash accounts into higher yielding accounts as interest rates moved higher. But Elliott believes that trend is slowing and the $33.8 billion sitting in cash and cash equivalents is stabilizing after dropping from $37 billion during the same quarter last year.
“That cash realignment activity will continue to decelerate,” he said.

ETFs recently featured in the blog include: Invesco DWA Technology Momentum ETF PTF, Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and ARK Genomic Revolution ETF ARKG.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
5 Technology ETFs at the Forefront of the August Rebound
Wall Street roared back after a sell-off early in the month as fears of recession eased. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index extended their winning streak to eight consecutive sessions, the longest in 2024. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its fifth straight daily gain. The surge recouped all the losses of the early August sell-off. Notably, the last week ushered in the biggest gains for the three major indexes this year (read: Stocks Log Best Week of the Year: Winning ETFs).
The technology sector, which bore the biggest brunt, rebounded strongly and once again led the market over the past week. That said, we have highlighted five technology ETFs that have been leading the way higher over the past week.
Inside the Rebound
The latest bouts of data signal a resilient economy, rekindling investors’ confidence in the stock market. Consumer sentiment rebounded in August for the first time in five months. It held up better than expected in July, with retail sales rising 1%. Meanwhile, annual inflation growth in July slowed to its lowest level since March 2021 while the core inflation dropped to the lowest since April 2021. This indicates that inflation is easing.
Additionally, the bets that the Fed will cut interest rates in September have been leading to risk-on trade. According to the latest CME FedWatch tool, traders have been pricing in a 72% chance the Fed will reduce rates by 0.25% at the September meeting and 28% odds of a 0.50% cut. When the Fed starts cutting rates, technology stocks will receive a boost. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, borrowing more money for further initiatives is cheaper when interest rates are low (read: Will Tech ETFs See Further Selloffs?).
The artificial intelligence (AI) boom will continue to fuel the rally in the tech sector as the expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth within the sector and beyond.

VNQ,2024-09-13,"SPY, QQQ: Track Top ETFs, Trends With Markets Monitor",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etf-coms-markets-monitor-160000653.html,"Many investors and advisors know that ETFs are not only a low-cost, effective means of capturing the performance of almost any segment of the market, they are also powerful tools for monitoring market trends. This dual purpose of ETFs is where etf.com’s Markets Monitor comes in as a powerful tool.
Learn more about how ETFs can be used to monitor market trends and how the Markets Monitor tool efficiently fills this need for investors and advisors.
How Can Investors Use ETFs to Monitor Market Trends?
Investors can use exchange-traded funds as a tool to monitor stock market trends in several ways, including sector rotation trends, market index tracking, style investing, international markets and technical analysis.
Here are a few common ways investors use ETFs to monitor market trends:
Sector rotation: ETFs offer exposure to various sectors, such as technology, healthcare or energy. By monitoring the performance of sector-specific ETFs, investors can gauge the relative strength or weakness of different sectors within the stock market. If a particular sector ETF consistently outperforms others, it may indicate a trend of market leadership, providing insight into the overall market sentiment.
Market index tracking: ETFs often track specific market indexes, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average or Nasdaq Composite. By monitoring the performance of these ETFs, investors can get a sense of the overall market trend. If the ETFs that track these indexes are consistently rising, it generally suggests a bullish market sentiment, while declines may indicate a bearish sentiment.
Style investing: ETFs can also be categorized based on investment styles, such as growth or value, or by factors, such as momentum or volatility. Investors can monitor the performance of growth-oriented ETFs relative to value-oriented ETFs to gain insights into prevailing market sentiments. During periods of economic expansion, growth stocks tend to outperform, while value stocks may do better during economic contractions.
International markets: ETFs can provide exposure to global markets and specific countries or regions. By tracking international ETFs, investors can monitor the performance of global markets and identify trends or divergences between different regions. This can be particularly useful for assessing the impact of global events or geopolitical factors on the stock market.
Technical analysis: ETF charts can be analyzed using technical indicators and chart patterns to identify trends, support/resistance levels and potential turning points. Technical analysis techniques, such as moving averages, trend lines or relative strength analysis, can be applied to ETFs to gain insights into the broader market trend.

VNQ,2024-07-22,Profit From Emerging Uptrend in REITs Using Call Options,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/profit-emerging-uptrend-reits-using-170000506.html,"We are in the midst of a great market rotation.
This is how bull markets usually pan out. They start with technology and growth stocks outperforming, as they are usually hit hardest during the prior bear market. Their earnings outlook also tends to bounce back quickly once things turn around. Then, as the rally begins to broaden out and interest rates start to decline, rate-sensitive pockets of the market join the party.
That’s exactly what we’re seeing play out at this moment. One area that is experiencing renewed strength is real estate, particularly real estate investment trusts (REITs). Real estate investment trusts either own or manage income-producing real estate, normally through directly investing in properties or the mortgages on those properties.
Investors can buy REITs directly, or may choose to further diversify by investing in REIT ETFs or mutual funds. There are several advantages to trading ETFs, including the ability to reduce market risk associated with owning individual stocks.
We can also trade options on ETFs, which is a great way to lower the inherent risk that comes with options trading.
The Vanguard Real Estate ETF VNQ is one example that heavily invests in a variety of REITs and has outperformed the broader market in July. As the Fed inches closer to its first rate cut of this cycle, investors are rotating into this rate-sensitive area.

Option Essentials
Before we analyze today’s trade, let’s review some option fundamentals as a refresher. My mantra when it comes to option investing is “keep it simple.”
There is no need to worry about complex mathematical formulas or equations. Over the years I’ve found that the more complicated a strategy is, the less likely it is to work over the long run. Our aim is to utilize a strategy that is easy to follow and has a long history of profitability.
Options are standardized contracts that give the buyer the right – but not the obligation – to buy or sell the underlying stock at a fixed price which is known as the strike price. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a stock, fund, or index, while a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the same. The investor who purchases an option, whether a put or call, is the option buyer, while the investor who sells a put or call is the seller or writer.
These contracts are valid for a specific period of time which ends on expiration day. There are weekly options, monthly options, and even LEAPS options which are longer-term options that have an expiration date of greater than one year.

VNQ,2024-06-12,TLT ITB Surge As Inflation Flatlines,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tlt-itb-surge-inflation-flatlines-192727714.html,"Stocks and bonds surged, with the S&P 500 hitting another record, after the government reported that consumer prices didn’t increase last month.

The S&P 500 surged as much as 1.3% to 5,446 after the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the consumer price index was unchanged in May. Economists were expecting the CPI to increase by 0.1%.

Meanwhile, the BLS said that the core CPI—which excludes food and energy—grew by less than 0.2%, its smallest increase since 2021. 

On a year-over-year basis, the headline and core CPI were up by 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively

The stock market rallied after the release of the consumer price data as investors reasoned that the Fed was more likely to cut rates this year with inflation on the downswing. 

The central bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision later today and is expected to hold rates steady. However, following the latest inflation readings, market-based indicators suggest that the Fed could slash its federal funds rate twice this year, in September and December.
Biggest ETF Movers
Some of the biggest gainers on Wednesday included home construction ETFs, like the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) and the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), which gained 4.4% and 5%, respectively, midday Wednesday.

Other interest-rate-sensitive segments of the market, like REITs, also rallied. The Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (VNQ) was last trading up by 2.3%.

Bond ETFs, whose prices move in the opposite direction as interest rates, rose as well.

The popular iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) surged 1.6% on Wednesday. The broader iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) was trading higher by 0.9%.
Fight Not Over
While the May CPI report was encouraging, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are likely to stress that the fight against inflation isn’t over.

Inflation came in hotter than expected during the first three months of the year, so central bankers may need to see several months of more benign readings before they feel comfortable lowering interest rates.

Still, the May data gave investors little reason to fear the trajectory of consumer prices. The month-over-month increase in core CPI of 0.16% is equal to an annualized rate of less than 2%— which is below the Fed’s inflation target—and the internals of the report were encouraging as well.

Core prices excluding housing dropped 0.4% from April to May, while core services excluding housing fell by 0.6%.

The next inflation data point that investors will be watching is the May producer price index, scheduled to be released on Thursday, followed by the PCE on June 28th.

Markets are in the red today after three major banks reported quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.

Wells Fargo, and Citibank both reported declines, but not as steeply as Wall Street had been expecting. Bank ETFs slid on the underwhelming reports. XLF, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, dropped 1%.

Though higher rates have typically boosted the financial sector, the ""higher for longer"" rate environment presents challenges. Higher rates send consumers elsewhere for better yields in savings accounts that smaller banks offer, while many seeking loans for financial products like mortgages have chosen to stay on the sidelines and wait for interest rates to come back to Earth.
Inflation concerns have been in the forefront this trading week after the consumer price index (CPI), released Wednesday, highlighted persistent and stubborn inflationary trends.
Investors are currently forecasting that the Fed won't cut rates until the July policy meeting at earliest, which will continue to weigh on real estate, and fixed income ETFs.

VNQ,2024-04-10,Here's What's Happening in Markets Today: April 10,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-whats-happening-markets-today-181401019.html,"Markets are in the red to kick off Wednesday trading after the consumer price index (CPI), an important gauge of inflation, rose more than expected.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), CPI jumped 0.4% for the month of March over the previous month compared to the 0.3% rise economists polled by Dow Jones had originally forecast
The hotter-than-expected inflation figures sank investor hopes that a rate cut would be coming as soon as the Fed's June policy meeting. Market probability of a June rate cut plummeted to roughly 20%, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool, dropping from a more than 50% chance just last week.
As markets took a leg lower, index ETFs were also in the red. SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust dropped more than 1% while DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust sank 1.25%.
Treasury yields jumped after the inflation report, particularly on the 10-year, a popular benchmark for mortgages and other loans. TLT, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, was down over 1% after market open as bond prices dropped. Yields and prices have an inverse relationship.
Bond ETFs have been on a rollercoaster ride this year as investors question whether the Fed will cut rates — and when.
TLT 1-MONTH TOTAL RETURN 
Currently the price of TLT is sitting at just over $91, close to the lows for the year.
The inflation report also hit real estate and technology equity prices. Higher rate environments keep real estate under pressure as mortgages and loans become more expensive, keeping buyers on the sidelines. VNQ, the Vanguard Real Estate ETF tumbled nearly 3.5% after the inflation report.
And for growth stocks like technology, higher interest rates take a bite out of future profits. While tech stocks have soared despite the higher rate environment over the past year, today's inflation report sent tech ETFs skidding. QQQ, the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust slid nearly 1%.

VNQ,2024-03-29,"Fed's Preferred Inflation Gauge Rose 2.8%, as Expected",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-preferred-inflation-gauge-rose-173000548.html,"Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), the Federal Reserve's key inflation metric, climbed 2.5% on an annual basis in February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Core PCE inflation, which strips away more volatile food and energy costs, rose 2.8%, in line with analyst expectations.
Month over month, PCE jumped 0.3% from the previous month, less than the 0.4% increase that analysts expected. The monthly rate also cooled slightly January's 0.4% month-over-month rise. Core PCE also rose 0.3% on a monthly basis.
While core inflation came in as expected, markets will have to wait until Monday to react as both stock and bond markets are closed for the Good Friday holiday. Though inflation has cooled since this time last year, today's report wasn't enough to raise hopes that the U.S. central bank would slash interest rates at its next meeting in May. Markets still forecast a nearly 96% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady at it's next interest rate decision meeting.
The U.S. Commerce Department report comes just two weeks after the Consumer Price (CPI) and Producer Price (PPI) indexes also showed inflation remaining stubbornly high. The data coupled with a robust job market, which heightens the risk of inflation by raising wages, worried the Fed and derailed market expectations for a rate cut early this year. While the Federal Reserve considers both inflation reports in making interest rate decisions, PCE remains the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.
FOMC Leaves Rate Unchanged
Last week, the bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, left the rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.50% where it's stood since July when it raised the rate a quarter point. That increased capped a 15-month prescription of hikes designed to ground soaring inflation, which rose to 9% in mid 2022.
The Fed is hoping to reduce inflation to 2% annually, but it has lingered over 3%, largely the result of high prices for energy, goods and some services.
In his semiannual testimony before Congress earlier month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the bank would likely cut rates this year but only after it ""gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.""
Powell noted cautiously that ""the economic outlook is uncertain, and ongoing progress...is not assured.""
In announcing its latest decision, the Fed reiterated its concerns about the economy and said it would ""carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks"" in future rate decisions.

When a young Michigan landlord named Joe called into The Ramsey Show for advice about what to do with a duplex he no longer cares for, Dave Ramsey gave it to him straight.
“You’re out, you’re done,” the personal finance expert said.

Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how
Commercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord
Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds
Joe admitted he was tired of having tenants — and of living underneath them — but he remained uncertain about how to handle his investment. He asked Ramsey whether it made sense to keep the duplex as a rental property and use the income to live elsewhere.
‘I would sell the crap out of this thing,” Ramsey responded during the September episode.
“Someday later, you may want to be a landlord again, but right now, you’ve had your trip on the crazy train and you’re tired of the crazy train. That’s ok. Take a break from crazy. Go get you a house,” he added.
Many Americans are still priced out of the housing market by high home prices and mortgage rates that are still hovering well above 7%.
But if you’re keen to invest in a rental property, but like Joe, you’re not sure if you’re cut out for the landlord life, here are three other ways you can invest in the real estate market.
Real estate investment trusts
Investing in a real estate investment trust (REIT) is a way to profit from the real estate market without having to buy a physical property or deal with any landlord duties.
Like giant landlords, REITs are publicly traded companies that own income-producing real estate like apartment buildings, shopping centers and office towers. They collect rent from tenants and pass that rent to shareholders in the form of regular dividend payments.
Generally, they’re described as high-return investments that provide solid dividends and the potential for moderate, long-term capital appreciation.
Also, as REITs are publicly traded, you can buy or sell shares any time and your investment can be as little or as large as you want — unlike buying a house, which usually requires a hefty down payment followed by a mortgage.
Real estate ETFs
Another easy way to invest in real estate without having to pick and choose which stocks to buy and sell, is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). You can think of an ETF as a diversified portfolio of stocks.

VNQ,2023-11-28,'This is just theft': California couple falls prey to serial squatters who refused to pay rent for months — 3 better ways to invest in real estate (without the trials of being a landlord),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/just-theft-sacramento-couple-fall-110000341.html,"A couple from Sacramento, California, fell prey to a pair of serial squatters who left their property in a state of disrepair after months of living there rent-free.
Mom-and-pop landlords Karen and Skip Morairty rented their Fair Oaks home to Ann and Mario Figueroa, who seemed like “wonderful people” and provided all the required documents — including a credit report and 401(k) statement — as reported via an ABC10 Originals investigation.

Save big on your holiday shopping with an app that’s already saved Americans $160 million
Owning real estate for passive income is one of the biggest myths in investing — but here's how you can actually make it work
The Morairtys handed over the keys to the Figueroas in August 2022 — and the problems began almost immediately. From September to December, the tenants were late paying their rent due to two alleged deaths and a serious illness in their family. They stopped paying altogether before Christmas.
Stuck paying the mortgage on their investment property out of their own pockets, the Morairtys reached out to their real estate agent, Gary Meek, for help. He told ABC10 he’s had “hours of conversations with Karen — frustrated, upset, crying.”
“Unfortunately, there are criminals out there that use amazing talent and education for bad,” Meek added — an opinion backed up by property manager Barry Mathis, hired by the Sacramento couple hired to help them evict the Figueroas, who described the squatters as “professional, deadbeat tenants” who have “learned to play the game.”
'They don't see the landlords as a victim'
Upon further investigation, ABC10 found that the Figueroas had squatted in at least eight houses in Sacramento County alone — some just blocks from each other — before targeting the Morairtys.
Former victim Tari Gunn told the news outlet they used the same “deaths in the family” excuses to live rent-free on her property for months. She reflected on the time and money she had to spend to evict them: “I just incurred so many financial issues … it was really hard.”
Mathis blamed California’s legal system for enabling squatters by making eviction such a difficult and costly process.
“We’re so much into victims’ rights but … in this case, they don’t see the landlords as a victim,” he said.
Mathis believes the law treats landlords like they’re all massive corporate entities with endless funds when in fact mom-and-pop landlords own and manage about 70% of small rental properties in the U.S., according to the National Association of Realtors.

VNQ,2023-11-15,This California handyman used cameras to force out squatters — but it's a dangerous tactic. Here are 3 ways to invest in real estate (without putting your safety at risk),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-handyman-found-creative-way-110000850.html,"When United Handyman Association founder Flash Shelton found squatters in his mother’s home, the only way he could get rid of them — after local police said they couldn’t help — was to out-squat the squatters.
“I called local law enforcement and as soon as they saw there was furniture in the house, they said I had a squatter situation, they had basically no jurisdiction and they couldn’t do anything,” Shelton told Fox Business’ Stuart Varney. “So, I dissected the laws over a weekend and basically figured out that until there’s civil action, the squatters didn’t have any rights, so if I could switch places with them and become the squatter myself, I would assume those squatter rights.”

He had his mom write up a lease for him and got it notarized. Then early one morning, he staked out the property, waiting for the squatters to leave. Once they'd gone, he let himself in and put up cameras then waited for them to return. ""...I just laid it out for them, told them that it was all locked up, cameras, and the only way they would get back in the house is if they broke in on camera, and I would prosecute. I told them they had a day to get their stuff out or the furniture was not theirs anymore,"" he said.
While Shelton’s scheme worked and the squatters left, it was a risky move that could have turned dangerous if the squatters hadn't accepted the situation and moved on.
Dealing with squatters, or even tenants, can get complicated and costly. Squatting is fueled by homelessness, and politicians have been reluctant to address it. News reports suggest the current system is stacked against homeowners and gives rise to long court battles.
Thankfully, there are safer and easier ways to make your mark in real estate.
Squatter rights
A squatter is someone who inhabits a piece of land or a building that they have no legal right to occupy — and without paying rent.
According to the American Apartment Owners Association (AAOA), most states have laws that give squatters rights to inhabit a property “in the event that the lawful owner does not evict or take action against,” them and they differ from state to state. Those laws typically only apply if the squatter has been illegitimately occupying a space for a specific period of time — after which, they will have gained “adverse possession,” and local law enforcement won't be of much help.
Squatters shouldn't be confused with trespassers. A blog post on the AAOA site explains: “A trespasser breaks into the property through an illegal entry and doesn’t have utilities, furniture or any form of a prior lease. Due to this, trespassers can be removed for violation of local loitering or trespassing laws.”
“I feel bad I can’t help everyone,” said Shelton in the FOX Business interview, who is now running a service to help other property owners deal with squatters. “I’m trying to change the laws.”
That being said, it's never advisable to take the law into your own hands, especially in a heated situation like an eviction. If the risk of serial squatters and the other trials and tribulations of being a landlord don’t appeal to you, here are three ways you can invest in real estate without all the hassle.
REITs
Investing in a real estate investment trust (REIT) is a way to profit from the real estate market without having to buy a house or worry about screening tenants, fixing damages, chasing down late payments or even facing trespassers.
REITs are publicly traded companies that own income-producing real estate like apartment buildings, shopping centers and office towers. They collect rent from tenants and pass that rent to shareholders in the form of regular dividend payments.
Essentially, REITs are giant landlords. To qualify as a REIT, a company must pay out at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends each year, in addition to other requirements. In exchange, they pay little to no income tax at the corporate level.
Generally, REITs are described as high-return investments that provide solid dividends and the potential for moderate, long-term capital appreciation.
Also, as REITs are publicly traded, you can buy or sell shares any time and your investment can be as little or as large as you want — unlike buying a house, which usually requires a hefty down payment followed by a mortgage.

Real estate ETFs
Another easy way to invest in real estate without having to pick and choose which stocks to buy and sell is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
And as the name suggests, ETFs trade on major exchanges, making them convenient to buy and sell. Some ETFs passively track an index, while others are actively managed. They all charge a fee — referred to as the management expense ratio — in exchange for managing the fund.
The Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), for example, provides investors with broad exposure to U.S. REITs. The fund currently holds 160 stocks with total net assets of $54.07 billion. Over the past 10 years, VNQ’s net asset value (NAV) has grown 4.65%, as of the end of October. Its management expense ratio is 0.12%.
Another example is the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE), which aims to replicate the real estate sector of the S&P 500 Index. It currently has 31 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.10%. Since the fund’s inception in October 2015, XLRE’s NAV has grown 4.77%, as of the end of October.
Both of these ETFs pay quarterly distributions.
Crowdfunding platforms
Through a crowdfunding platform, you can buy a percentage of physical real estate — from rental properties to commercial properties. You can even buy a stake in digital real estate.
If you’re an experienced investor looking to up your stake in real estate, there are also options for accredited investors that often have higher minimum investments that can reach tens of thousands of dollars or more.
If you’re not an accredited investor, many platforms allow you to invest smaller sums, even as low as $100.
These online platforms make real estate investing more accessible by simplifying the process and lowering the barrier to entry.
Sponsors of crowdfunded real estate deals usually charge fees to investors — typically in the range of 0.5% to 2.5% of whatever you’ve invested.

And a college student had to learn that the hard way when she tried her hand at being a landlord to her school friends.
Reddit user, EqualBudget_3179, recently posted a cautionary tale on the site after her uncle let her live rent-free in one of his investment properties and collect rent from three other tenants to help pay for her expenses.

EqualBudget_3179 offered their friends these extra bedrooms for $700 per month each – a good $200 to $800 cheaper than other houses near her college. They all immediately said yes. But when one of them asked about the total cost of rent, the friends freaked out when they found out the arrangement with her uncle.
“That blew up in my face because now every [sic] one of my friends [is] calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money,” EqualBudget_3179 writes in her post. The Redditor goes on to write that she ultimately decided to ask them to move out.
“My uncle gave me some advice … Never mix money with friends or I might lose both.”
There are certainly challenges that come with being a landlord. Here are some pros and cons to help you decide if it's a life for you — along with some stress-free real estate investing alternatives if it's not worth the risk.
The pros
While being a landlord can be a lot of work, the time and money investment does have some serious appeal. Rental properties are assets that generate monthly income and allow you to benefit from any price appreciation in the long term.
Rent prices went up an average of 5.45% over the last year – and over 30% in some New York and Florida towns, according to a SmartAsset study that looked at rent prices in over 1,800 U.S. cities. And with 93% of single family homes currently occupied, demand for rental units is high. This means you could be more likely to have your pick of prospective tenants and get your unit rented in a shorter amount of time.
If you decide to sell the property, then having the rental unit may add more appeal for prospective buyers.
Whether you sell the property or you have that extra monthly income coming in, the extra cash can be part of your retirement nest egg or provide you with the cash to invest to further build your portfolio or even buy your next home.

VNQ,2023-10-20,Sector ETFs to Win/Lose Amid Surging Treasury Yields,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sector-etfs-win-lose-amid-170000991.html,"Wall Street has been upbeat in the first half of 2023 despite a few occasional hiccups, mainly due to a less-hawkish Fed, better-than-expected corporate earnings and the AI mania. However, Wall Street’s run in the second half of the year hasn’t been smooth so far as rates have been rising.
The U.S. Treasury yields have been on a surge lately, driven by expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer to fight inflation. The U.S. jobs market has been hot despite higher rates while U.S. consumers have been resilient despite high inflation. This may lead the Fed to enact one more rate hike in November this year.
As of Oct 19, 2023, the benchmark U.S. treasury yield stood at 4.98%, up from 4.69% recorded at the start of the month. Given this, investors must be interested in finding out which equity sectors perform well and which sectors perform poorly amid rising interest rates. Let’s find out.
Winning Sectors
Insurance – iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK)
Insurance companies normally invest a considerable portion of their premium revenue in various safe financial instruments, including treasury bonds. They do this to generate investment income that can help cover claims and operational expenses.The yield on these bonds is a key determinant of the investment income the insurance companies earn. Moreover, more car and home purchases are seen in a steadily recovering economy, which indicates more policy writing.
Consumer Staples – Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP)
This sector is defensive in nature and known for its durability.  The demand for the consumer staples sector remains consistent across all types of economies, even in the face of rising interest rates. Companies in the consumer staples sector normally witness relatively stable cash flows. This stability can provide a buffer during economic challenges and help companies to continue operating and paying dividends to investors. The fund XLP charges 10 bps in fees and yields 2.78% annually.
Losing Sectors
Utilities – Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU)
Though the sector is defensive in nature and known for its resilience, the sector typically underperforms in rising rate environment. The sector is capital-intensive in nature, as interest rates increase, the cost of borrowing for utilities companies also rises. Higher borrowing costs can erode profit margins and potentially limit their ability to invest in new projects. Utilities stocks offer sizable dividends. But rising interest rates can make fixed-income investments more attractive compared to utility stocks.

XLE,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) rose more than 5% at one point in the session to trade just below $72 per barrel. It settled around $70.40. Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also climbed as much as 5% to hover firmly above $75 per barrel before settling at $74.
Tensions in the Middle East have escalated in recent days after Israel launched ground raids in southern Lebanon targeting the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah.
The moves higher in oil led to an overall boost in the energy sector (XLE), which was far and away the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, up over 2%.

One concern around the crude market's rise is the impact it could have on inflation, as higher energy prices over the long term can often increase input costs for goods and services. This could potentially lead to more price increases across the board, including non-energy categories.
James Reilly, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote Tuesday that ""much remains uncertain"" in response to Tuesday's spike in prices.
He argued a key issue will be the attack's ""size and whether it inflicts significant damage, particularly in civilian areas. A major escalation by Iran risks bringing the US into the war, which Tehran will presumably seek to avoid.""
""In any event, the impact on oil prices will remain the key channel of transmission to the global economy,"" Reilly added, noting Iran accounts for about 4% of global oil output. ""An important consideration will be whether Saudi Arabia increases production if Iranian supplies were disrupted.""
Reilly said, as a rule of thumb, a 5% increase in oil prices adds about 0.1 percentage points to headline inflation in advanced economies like the United States.
""As such, we think that it would take a much larger (and sustained) increase in oil prices to have a bearing on central bank policy.""

Outside Tuesday's moves, oil has been on a steady downward trend over the past few months amid an improving global supply picture. That's helped lower overall consumer prices, bringing inflation closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
In a note published Monday prior to Iran's attack, Goldman Sachs said it expects energy prices' contribution to year-over-year CPI to fall further over the next several months, eventually pushing headline CPI as low as 1.9%.
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points at its policy meeting last month, citing that recent moderation of inflation. But some officials have warned that inflationary pressures remain an upside risk.

XLE,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

XLE,2024-09-20,Microsoft goes nuclear to power AI data centers: Expert,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-goes-nuclear-power-ai-204151380.html,"Nuclear energy has been a hot topic in investors' minds after Microsoft (MSFT) and Constellation Energy (CEG) announced an agreement to restore a dormant nuclear power plant to power the tech company’s AI and cloud data centers.
Radiant Energy Group founder and managing director Mark Nelson joins Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman to explain how nuclear energy could power the artificial intelligence era.
Microsoft wants to restore the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania, known for one of the largest nuclear disasters in the US when one of the plant's two reactors melted down in 1979.
A nuclear engineer himself, Nelson explains that the plant’s other reactor “kept going for 40 years. The only reason it closed in 2019 is because fossil fuels were really cheap.”
He says there’s a renewed interest in nuclear energy today because “we're running out of other energy sources… we're running out of power, and we're realizing that if we're going to have everybody buy electric vehicles, we have to be able to charge it from power plants that run all the time.”

Nuclear power plants could help meet the energy-intensive needs of training and running AI, which has brought the utilities sector into focus. Nelson says building new nuclear plants and restoring existing ones could help.
“The very best American design for a nuclear plant is being built in China over and over again for about four years or so per reactor and about $3 billion. I don't think we're going to meet China's prices for building our reactors, but we could probably do a lot better building our reactors if we do it in series with the same design, the same plant layout, and we do it over and over,"" the expert tells Yahoo Finance.
“Fortunately, we've got designs that are licensed and ready to go today at existing nuclear plants that already serve tens of millions of customers. Aand those are the plants that are being approached by the data centers. So I think to get over this hump, we have to accept that we've got outstanding equipment ready to install. We've just forgotten how to do it and we need to do it the same way every time.”

XLE,2024-09-11,The US is 'making history' with energy demand. Expert explains,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/us-making-history-energy-demand-223000476.html,"Energy policy was a key debate topic between presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Tortoise senior portfolio manager and managing director Rob Thummel joins Market Domination to discuss the future of US energy policy.
""We do believe in an all-of-the-above approach to really providing energy supply. Energy demand is just going to go up, and it's going to go up every single year... We're really making history here, a little bit in the US, as the US being the largest producer of energy in the world, the largest exporter of energy in the world. This is really significant,"" Thummel tells Yahoo Finance.
He explains that the US has a lot of low-cost, low-carbon energy options, which is a ""foundational element of growing economies."" Thus, he believes that as US oil helps grow other economies, it's also contributing to domestic growth.
""That's partially why you're seeing the potential for AI development here is because the low-cost energy that's in the US, that's partially why we'll have advanced manufacturing come back to the US, is because of the low cost of energy,"" he adds.

XLE,2024-09-04,Nvidia stock tumbles to lowest level since mid-August,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-tumbles-to-lowest-level-since-mid-august-173835458.html,"Nvidia stock (NVDA) extended losses early on Wednesday after sinking more than 9% to close at $108 as the overall market declined on the first trading day of the month.
Its shares fell another 3% in premarket trading after the Department of Justice sent subpoenas to Nvidia and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant provider of AI chips.
The AI chipmaker was the worst performer among the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks on Tuesday, falling to its lowest level since Aug. 12.

""I don't think it's down on isolation; lots of things are down today,"" Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein senior analyst, told Yahoo Finance in a live interview on Tuesday morning.
Technology (XLK) stocks led the market declines, followed by Energy (XLE) and Industrials (XLI).
Tuesday's decline comes less than a week after Nvidia posted quarterly results that beat consensus estimates but failed to send the stock price higher.
""The print was actually very good. The issue people had on it was not so much the revenue, it was the gross margins. They're guiding gross margins down a little bit into the end of the year,"" said Rasgon.
Nvidia is expected to ramp up production of its next-generation Blackwell chip in the fourth quarter of this year, which could send the stock higher, said Rasgon.
""I think right now people are worried, kind of [treading] water a little bit until those products get into the marketplace,"" said Rasgon. ""Once they start ramping Q4, Q1 ... if that ramp is solid, I expect the stock would probably follow.""

Wall Street remained mostly bullish on the stock following the earnings release, with Stifel analysts reiterating their Buy rating and $165 price target.
""Bigger picture, the modernization of data center compute continues and, in our view, NVDA remains the primary beneficiary,"" wrote the analysts last week.
Up until last week, Nvidia had led the recent rebound in stocks, climbing nearly 25% in a span of three weeks following a global market sell-off.
Despite Tuesday's losses, the stock is up more than 115% year to date.

XLE,2024-08-22,Energy ETFs Lag As Oil Gives Up 2024 Gains,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-etfs-lag-oil-gives-191609815.html,"The price of oil hit its lowest level since January this week, weighing on oil and energy exchange-traded funds.

Front month West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contracts closed at $71.93 per barrel on Wednesday, their lowest price since hitting $70.77 on Jan. 8.

Global oil demand is on track to increase by less than 1 million barrels per day this year and next year, according to the International Emergency Agency, less than half the pace of 2023.

Demand growth is slowing at the same time that supply is expected to accelerate, with growth of 730,000 barrels per day in 2024 and 1.9 million barrels per day in 2025, according to the IEA.

“In June, Chinese oil demand contracted for a third consecutive month, driven by a slump in industrial inputs, including for the petrochemical sector,"" the IEA wrote in its latest Oil Market Report. ""By contrast, demand in advanced economies, especially for US gasoline, has shown signs of strength in recent months.” 
Based on the IEA’s forecast for supply in demand in 2025, the agency says that global oil inventories could increase by an average of 860,000 barrels per day. 

The expectations of an oversupplied market are partly to blame for oil’s recent weakness. Concerns that demand could weaken further if economies in China, the U.S. and elsewhere slow more than expected could also be weighing on the commodity.
USO Outperforms, XLE Lags
Despite the fact that oil has given up most of its gains for the year—WTI is up by 2%, while Brent is up by 0.2%—ETFs tied to oil futures have delivered decent returns.

The United States Oil Fund (USO) and the United States Brent Oil Fund (BNO), which track WTI and Brent, respectively, are up by 10% and 9%.
/uso
The outperformance can be attributed to futures curves in backwardation, a phenomenon that benefits ETFs that hold and roll futures contracts.

Meanwhile, the Energy Select Sector Fund (XLE) is higher by 7.7% on a year-to-date basis, in-line with the oil ETFs, but a sharp underperformance versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which is up 18%.

Energy is one of four stock market sectors with a gain of less than 10% this year.

The rest of the solar industry has not performed as well, seemingly due to higher for longer interest rates.
Sunrun CEO Mary Powell joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into the company's performance and the solar industry at large.
Powell sets the scene for why solar has performed the way it has:
""There were some interesting currents over the last couple of years. I would say the most powerful was the rapid rise in interest rates. And, you know, Sunrun, what we did is what great companies do, which is we just leaned right into the wind and said, 'We're going to come out stronger [on] the other side.' And we have emerged stronger from basically every metric you could look at.""
""The biggest tailwind... is the fact that utility rates are doing nothing but rising at the same time that reliability is going down. So cost is going up, the predictability and stability is going down,"" Powell explains to Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton.

Stewart Glickman, CFRA Research Energy Equity Analyst and Deputy Research Director joined Market Domination to discuss.
Chevron (CVX) saw revenue of $51.18 billion for the quarter, higher than expected. But the oil giant's adjusted earnings per share of $2.55 missed expectations of $2.93. Glickman described the print as ""disappointing,"" and downgraded the shares to a Hold from a Buy.
Beyond the quarter, Chevron now faces a lengthy delay in its attempted acquisition of Hess (HES). Chevron saying in a securities filing that an arbitration case brought by rival ExxonMobil (XOM) could drag on well into 2025. Glickman noted that prolonged uncertainty was a factor in downgrading the stock, noting he and his team have ""thrown in the towel"" on the Chevron story.
Conversely, ExxonMobil had a stellar quarter with a beat on its top and bottom line. The company's production securing a big boost from its recent acquisition of Pioneer. Glickman raised his price target on ExxonMobil's stock, noting the oil giant has ""a much better story to tell.""

TCW senior portfolio manager Eli Horton joins Wealth! to discuss where he believes investors should look to capitalize on the AI trend.
Horton emphasizes that ""the literal foundation"" of AI is the power and electric grid. He notes that companies are investing billions in their AI initiatives because ""this is mission-critical to their businesses."" This investment, he explains, flows into chips, servers and networking, and data centers — all of which require substantial power consumption. Horton describes this as ""an indirect way to invest in this theme.""
However, he cautions that many investors may not be exposed to the true ""winners"" of the AI trade. ""The winners of these themes are old economy industrial-type businesses,"" Horton tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting companies within electrical equipment and power generation sectors.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer joins Asking for a Trend to discuss his takeaways from the trading day.
First, he points to the continued broadening of the market as a major trend. Energy (XLE), financials (XLF), and industrials (XLI) all led the market's rally while tech (XLP) came in just shy of the S&P 500 over the last five days.
Next, the Russell 2000 (^RUT) hit its highest level since 2022. As more economic data points to cooling inflation, confidence grows in the potential for a September rate cut, giving small caps a boost.
Finally, the economy is showing signs of overall moderation. As June's retail sales report is set to be released on Tuesday, Wall Street is expecting sales to fall about 0.2%. Schafer explains that if the print comes in line with expectations, it would serve as yet another data point showing that the economy is responding to higher interest rates. This would also give the Federal Reserve more confidence in initiating an interest rate cut.

XLE,2024-07-01,"Trump's Improving Odds Tied to Dip in TLT, TAN",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-improving-odds-tied-dip-120000364.html,"Investors are trying to assess the political landscape following last week’s presidential debates. Observers from across the political spectrum panned President Biden’s performance, which POLITICO contributor Jeff Greenfield called “the worst debate performance in American history.”
While a lot of time remains until the November elections, the likelihood of a Trump victory edged higher after the debate.
For markets as a whole, the shifting odds had little impact.

On Friday, the S&P 500 fluctuated near record highs, continuing to show the same resiliency it has all year.

Under the surface, there was a little more action. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) plummeted by nearly 5%, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) rose by 0.5% midday Friday as investors attempted to price in the potential for a more fossil-fuel-friendly administration.

Meanwhile, the iShares 30+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) dropped 1.3% as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond spiked 8 basis points to 4.5%.

In contrast, the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (SHY) and the 2-year Treasury yield were little changed.
Inflationary Monetary Policy
If elected, Trump has indicated that he would like more sway over monetary policy, with the aim of keeping interest rates lower than they might otherwise be.

According to some economists, that could push inflation higher, which would be bearish for bonds.

Another category that would be greatly affected by a Trump presidency are China and Europe ETFs. Trump started a trade war with China, and to a lesser extent, Europe, during his first term, and all indications are that he will double down on that policy in his second term, with across-the-board tariff increases. 

However, there was little movement in either the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) or the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) on Friday, suggesting that this isn’t a risk that investors are ready to worry about.

Wood says that the move was made in case the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust conversion to an ETF is not approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an interview with Yahoo Finance earlier this week, Wood says she expects the SEC to approve a number of spot bitcoin ETFs all at once when a deadline is reached next month.

JOSH LIPTON: Moving on, let's get some tickers, Julie Hyman, let's do that. Cathie Wood's Ark investment shaking up its crypto holdings, the asset management company picking up shares of ProShares Bitcoin strategy ETF while dumping its holdings of grayscale and selling shares of Coinbase. So this is interesting, I mean Cathie Wood makes moves. It gets attention, Julie, we know that.
So she, Cathie Wood's funds making some changes, Bitcoin related holdings, Ark next generation internet ETF looks like sold all of its remaining shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. But made some buys too, bought about four million shares. It looks like, the ProShares Bitcoin strategy ETF, which obviously that invests in Bitcoin futures, Wood telling reporters that the move was made in case grayscale trust conversion to an ETF isn't actually approved by regulators in January.
JULIE HYMAN: Which is so fascinating because she just told us earlier in the week that she, and she's been relatively confident, cautiously confident that her own offering for a Bitcoin spot ETF in cooperation with 21 shares would be approved, and she's also said consistently as have other analysts who follow the space that they're all going to be approved at once, that the SEC is at pains not to show favoritism in the order in which it approves some of these ETFs, that it would approve a bunch at once.
So it's interesting that she's sort of hedging her bets on this, of course she will be in more direct competition with grayscale if it is approved and her ETF is approved, the two would be in competition, they're both a spot Bitcoin ETF, so it's interesting here that she is making this move. She's doing a couple of other things here, she did buy also some shares of, again the fund that she runs with the partner 21 shares that's a futures product and also sold some Coinbase shares, which is still the top holding over there.

DGRO,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

DGRO,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

DGRO,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

DGRO,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

DGRO,2024-10-01,Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger to be Replaced by Rick Wurster,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-ceo-walt-bettinger-replaced-200604871.html,"Charles Schwab Corp., the fifth-largest ETF issuer, has named its next chief executive officer, current president Rick Wurster, who will step into his new role Jan. 1.
The Westlake, Texas-based financial services conglomerate announced the news Tuesday morning, describing it as “part of a multi-year succession plan” that includes the Dec. 31 retirement of current CEO Walt Bettinger.
The executive transition follows the June retirement of Bernie Clark as head of Schwab Advisor Services after more than 25 years with the company, including 15 as the head of the registered investment advisor business.
Clark was replaced by Jon Beatty, the chief operating officer of Schwab Advisor Services.
Wurster, who has been president since 2021, will retain the president title when he takes over the CEO role. And Bettinger will continue to serve as executive co-chairman of Schwab’s board of directors.
Schwab Asset Management has 31 ETFs that combine for $375 billion. Two-thirds of those ETFs are slated for share-price splits on Oct. 11 in a move aimed at driving appeal among financial advisors and retail-class investors.
Bettinger, who has been the CEO since 2008, has overseen a growth in client assets to $9.74 trillion from $1.14 trillion when he took over.
Schwab's Market Capitalization Soars
The client brokerage, banking and workplace participant accounts grew to 43.2 million from 9.3 million. And Schwab’s market capitalization has grown to approximately $119 billion from $18 billion in 2008.
Bettinger also oversaw the acquisition of rival custodian TD Ameritrade in 2020.
The company did not make anyone available for an interview for this story, but in a prepared statement, Bettinger said, “As I approach my 65th birthday in 2025, the time is right for me to transition from day-to-day duties and focus on my role as executive co-chairman of the Schwab board of directors.”
Founder and co-chair Charles R. Schwab described Bettinger’s tenure as “the most significant growth in the company’s history.”
“He has earned the right to determine his retirement as CEO,” Schwab said in a prepared statement.

DGRO,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

DGRO,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) – Average Daily Volume: 169.7 million shares

ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ provides three times inverse exposure to the daily performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, charging 95 bps in annual fees. The index measures the performance of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq based on market capitalization.

Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares (SOXL) – Average Daily Volume: 92.2 million shares

DGRO,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

DGRO,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

DGRO,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index.

If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

DGRO,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

DGRO,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:

2. Advanced Micro Devices

4. Texas Instruments

5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

DRIV,2024-04-11,Yellen Warns of ‘China Shock’ as EV ETFs Languish,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yellen-warns-china-shock-ev-120000709.html,"There’s more to this week’s economic and market news than the CPI report.
While market observers sifted through Wednesday’s disappointing March Consumer Price Index, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrapped up her week-long visit to Guangzhou and Beijing.
The key takeaway for investors: Yellen’s second trip to China in nine months did not result in any shifts in either the U.S. or China’s policies regarding investment and export restrictions.
While the Biden administration has maintained Trump-era tariffs, there was no explicit threat of new sanctions.
Yellen, however, addressed concerns over a return of “China shock,” which refers to the negative impact on the U.S. economy following China's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.
In the ensuring years, Chinese exports, particularly of manufactured goods, surged to the United States and Europe.
“Now, we are seeing an increase in business investment in a number of ‘new’ industries targeted by the PRC’s industrial policy. That includes electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar,” Yellen stated in a press release.
Related ETFs are the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV), down nearly 2% year-to-date, and the TSLA Daily Bear ETF (TSLQ), up almost 40% this year, as it bets against the declining EV maker, Tesla, Inc.
China’s Impact on U.S. Inflation
China’s economy Chinese economic growth can have a mixed impact on U.S. inflation, depending on the specific circumstances. Some investment banks, like Goldman Sachs, have recently revised their forecasts upwards. In April 2024, Goldman Sachs raised its China growth projection for 2024 to 5%, citing manufacturing strength in the first quarter.
Here’s how Chinese economic growth can affect U.S. inflation:
Increased supply: A growing Chinese economy often translates to increased production of goods. This can lead to a larger supply of imported goods in the U.S., potentially putting downward pressure on prices for American consumers.
Change in commodity prices: China is a major consumer of raw materials. If its economy grows rapidly, demand for these materials might rise. However, if the increase in supply outpaces a rise in demand, it can lead to lower commodity prices, which are a key driver of inflation for many goods.
Demand surge: A strong Chinese economy can also lead to surging domestic demand for goods. This can create competition for resources with other countries, including the U.S., potentially driving up prices for both countries.
Global supply chain strain: If China's growth strains global supply chains, it can lead to bottlenecks and disruptions. This can cause shortages of goods and drive prices higher for consumers worldwide, including the U.S.

DRIV,2024-03-28,3 EV Stocks to Buy for the Next Bull Run: March 2024,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-ev-stocks-buy-next-101900557.html,"The electric vehicle (EV) market continues to suffer from an ongoing slump. Slower sales growth and price wars have impacted both large and small EV stocks with investors unsure if it is a good time to buy them. The Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV) which holds around 84 EV and autonomous vehicles stocks, has fallen more than 1% year-to-date, underscoring how many EV stocks have broadly underperformed the general market.
Despite that, now may be a good time to find EV stocks to buy that have seen their multiples fall over the past few months. Many of these companies are trading at relatively cheap valuation multiples and, despite the broader slump, are continuing to invest in capturing market share. Although a slump may blight growth in the short-term, electric vehicles are increasingly likely to be a part of the future of transportation.
Here are three EV stocks to buy in the coming bull run.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
BYD (BYDDY)

Source: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen
BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) has experience skyrocketing growth in just the past few years. From starting out as just a smartphone battery maker to being laughed at by Elon Musk, BYD has become the world’s top EV maker, trouncing its American rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in electric vehicle sales. In Q4 2023, BYD sold 526,409 electric vehicles, while Tesla sold 484,507.
Despite an EV slowdown, BYD is still increasing its sales year-over-year. In particular, in January 2024 the company sold 205,588 electric vehicles, up 33.1% YOY, but down more than 34% monthly. Similarly, February sales declined nearly 40%, but this is at least somewhat attributable to the Lunar New Year holiday. The Chinese EV maker was not the only large electric vehicle company to report a month-over-month decline in sales growth.
To cushion the slowdown in sales, BYD and its competitors have pursued price cuts in their expensive models. For example, BYD’s Yuan Plus SUV has a price tag of 119,800 yuan, approximately $16,642, which is nearly 12% less than where it was before. This price war will likely intensify, especially as the EV slump continues. The company also remains the second largest player in the global battery market with 14.4% of market share as of January 2024, according to a recent study.
BYD is and continues to be larger than Tesla in EV sales, and the stock only trades at 17x forward earnings, which could present a great opportunity for interested investors.

Consequently, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the darling among EV stocks, has declined more than 20% year-to-date (YTD), compared to a 5% increase in the S&P 500 index during the same period.
Yet a recent report highlights EV sales could account for 35% of all global new car sales by 2030. With that information, here are three EV stocks that could gain significant traction in 2024.
Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV)

We start our discussion with an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that gives brad exposure to EV stocks. Holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV) include not only EV manufacturers but also critical components like autonomous vehicle technology, lithium batteries, and key materials.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
DRIV currently has 75 holdings. The leading sectors in the fund include consumer discretionary (37.5%), information technology (29.1%), industrials (16%), and materials (12.2%). United States-based companies top the list (55.7%) followed by Japan (10.9%) and South Korea (5.3%).
The fund not only offers access to EV stocks but also to prominent tech stocks across multiple sectors and industries. In fact, the leading names on the roster include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Toyota (NYSE:TM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). This highlights a rotation towards tech stocks due to near-term cyclical headwinds in the EV space.
Among car manufacturers in the ETF are Tesla, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F). The fund has declined more than 3% YTD and is currently trading 25% below than its record high in late 2021. We should also note that the annual expense ratio for DRIV is 0.68% per year or $68 on a $10,000 investment.

Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has emerged as a leading player among China’s EV stocks, strategically targeting both hybrid and premium segments. By offering hybrid engines, the company addresses range anxiety, enabling potential customers to confidently to travel long distances across China.
The company reported robust third-quarter results that surpassed revenue projections which came in at $4.75 billion, up 271% year-over-year (YoY). Vehicle orders surged to a record high of 50.000 in December. Net income also saw a significant improvement.

DRIV,2024-02-20,3 Renewable Energy ETFs to Watch Now: VCAR Leads the Way,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-renewable-energy-etfs-watch-110000987.html,"Most renewable energy stocks struggled in 2023. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN), which holds some 135 different clean energy public companies, fell more than 20% in 2023. Similarly, the Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS), which holds about 53 different solar names, plummeted 38%.
Elevated interest rates and relatively lower oil prices fomented an overall disinterest in renewable energy stocks, many of which rely on debt capital to build out their facilities and products. However, with interest rates likely to come down in 2024, coupled with the number of government incentives flooding the sector, 2024 could turn out to be a much better year for clean renewable energy stocks.
Below are three renewable energy ETFs to put on your watchlist.

Simplify Volt RoboCar Disruption and Tech ETF (VCAR)

Simply Volt RoboCar Disruption and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:VCAR) takes a concentrated approach. It focuses on the few companies that appear poised to dominate new technology industries, including the electric vehicles and autonomous driving industries as well as the artificial intelligence space. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), for example, are amongst the ETF’s largest holdings.
Moreover, this particular ETF attempts to enhance investor returns by employing the use of options. VCAR is trading up nearly 7% YTD, beating both the S&P500 and the Nasdaq. With an expense ratio of just above 1%, this ETF can be a great way by which investors diversify their holdings and reap decent rewards.
Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV)

Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV) invests in stocks of companies operating across development of electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. The ETF has more than $638 million of assets under management. Unlike the VCAR ETF, DRIV does not take a concentrated investment strategy. The exchange-traded fund holds 84 names with Nvidia and Toyota (NYSE:TM) being the top two names, both of which have a weighting of less than 4%.
Currently, DRIV shares are down more than 3% in 2024, likely due to the way EV stocks have performed thus far. However, DRIV’s share price could pick up as interest rates decline in the latter half of 2024.
Global X Solar ETF (RAYS)

The Global X Solar ETF was mentioned in the beginning of this article, and the funds primary focus is on solar energy. Having both a proclivity for growth and value stocks, the ETF invests in stocks of companies operating in different segments of the solar space, including solar energy materials, solar energy systems and components, power production, technology, installation and maintenance.

DRIV,2024-01-23,"Investing in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Can Be Risky, but Here's a Spectacular Way to Do It",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-153000014.html,"Artificial intelligence (AI) was the dominant stock market theme in 2023. Nvidia experienced a surge in demand for its data center chips designed to process AI workloads, and its stock soared 239% for the year. It was the best performer in the entire S&P 500 index, and it has continued to march higher in 2024.
Shares of other popular AI companies also delivered market-beating returns, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.
But AI is no different from any other tech revolution throughout history, in that not every company will succeed. There will be winners and losers, and the industry is already experiencing volatility. C3.ai was the world's first stand-alone enterprise AI company when it was founded in 2009, and while its stock surged 157% in 2023, it's still trading 85% below its all-time high.
But you don't need a crystal ball to make money over the long term. There's a way for investors to buy AI stocks while limiting their exposure to the inevitable failures.

Exchange-traded funds might be the answer
Instead of buying several individual AI stocks -- which certainly involves picking winners and losers -- investors can buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on AI. An ETF can hold up to thousands of individual stocks to give investors exposure to a specific index, sector, or strategy.
Given ETFs have many holdings, the failure of any one company shouldn't derail the entire portfolio. That protects investors from catastrophic losses, which is crucial when deploying money into any new segment of the market.
Several AI-focused ETFs have come online over the last few years. I'll explain why the Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) and the Global X Autonomous and Electric Vehicle ETF (NASDAQ: DRIV) are two great options.
1. Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AIQ)
The Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AIQ) is one of the best options for investors who are new to investing in AI. It holds 86 different stocks, so it's one of the most diversified funds in the AI space.
However, AIQ is heavily weighted toward its top 10 positions, which account for 34.7% of the total value of its portfolio. That can lead to heightened volatility, but those positions include some of the most popular stocks in the AI industry:

GGLL,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

GGLL,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

GGLL,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

GGLL,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

GGLL,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

GGLL,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) – Average Daily Volume: 169.7 million shares

ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ provides three times inverse exposure to the daily performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, charging 95 bps in annual fees. The index measures the performance of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq based on market capitalization. ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ has AUM of $2.6 billion.

Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares (SOXL) – Average Daily Volume: 92.2 million shares

Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares targets the semiconductor corner of the technology sector with three times leveraged exposure to the NYSE Semiconductor Index. Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares has amassed about $12.1 billion in its asset base while charging 72 bps in fees per year.

Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares (SOXS) – Average Daily Volume: 60.8 million shares

GGLL,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

GGLL,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

GGLL,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs.

If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

GGLL,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

GGLL,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

GGLL,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

ICLN,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

China’s move to address issues within its solar industry and the recent $1.7 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. government to hydrogen developer Plug Power has buoyed the sector in recent weeks.
The surge comes as the theme has struggled in recent years. Challenges around oversupply and interest sensitivity have magnified the issue. The sector was among the worst performing in 2023.
Among the top performers was the Fidelity Clean Energy UCITS ETF (FNRG), generating returns of 15.6% over the last month and contrasting returns of -21.7% in 2023.
FNRG’s top three holdings are Vestas Wind Systems A/S (4.4%), First Solar 4.4% and Verbund AG (3.7%).
The Global X Hydrogen UCITS ETF (HYGG) also rebounded, returning 28.9% over the last month compared to -40% across 2023.
The top weighting includes U.S. hydrogen producer Bloom Energy (15%), followed by Nel ASA (12.2%) and Plug Power (11%).
Following HYGG, the VanEck Hydrogen Economy UCITS ETF (HDGB) returned 18.4% over the last month.
Clean Energy Sentiment Improving?
Sentiment surrounding clean energy ETFs may also be rallying as interest rates begin to soften after aggressive hikes in 2023 and the financing of clean energy projects accelerates in the U.S.
For example, Orsted received an investment of $680 million from JPMorgan for solar and solar storage assets last month, made possible under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which launched in 2022.
Bullishness surrounding AI also aided returns, given the technology’s heavy consumption of electricity.
For example, recent research from Goldman Sachs found that a ChatGPT query needs nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search, with the same report estimating data center power demand will grow 160% by 2030.

Great to have you here once again with us, Cinthia First and foremost, the commodities ETFs-- how much of a bid are they catching now that we're seeing some of these new all time highs or the new highs in gold?
CINTHIA MURPHY: Hi, Brad. They're finally hitting everybody's radar. I mean, as you know, people look to commodities when they're trying to hedge against inflation, when we're looking to diversify portfolios. But in the last year or so, it's been all about big tech. So people have paid very little attention to the diversifiers because everybody was trying to ride that tech wave.
And this year, that's starting to change. So we're seeing a bit under commodities, we're seeing a lot more commentary from the market experts, the analysts, about the importance of commodities and the opportunity in commodities, which has been a segment that's typically under owned in the advisory channel, it's under owned by most investors. And it's at an attractive positions right now because they're so overlooked so often, especially in the middle of a tech craze. So this has been an interesting moment for these types of investments right now.
- It's particularly interesting, especially given some of the concerns that we've had really murmuring about now, and a loud murmur, about the economy and the likelihood of a recession and where that has actually perhaps fueled some demand for assets like gold. How have you been evaluating that?

The conference aims to create ""specific solutions that must be scaled to limit warming to 1.5 degrees,"" according to COP28.
David Callaway, Callaway Climate Insights Founder, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the COP28 conference and how a recent pledge from the United State and China to cooperate on climate change could provide momentum to upcoming talks.
Callaway explains why world leaders are slow make significant progress on climate issues: ""The pressure continues to rise on these global leaders and then they have alternative pressures such as facing reelections and the higher costs of climate change. So they're not on the same schedule. They need to be essentially shocked into that and I think what we saw this year in climate disasters, something like $89 billion in climate disasters over the last few years, is going to start to put that pressure on.""

SEANA SMITH: What is-- I guess, in order for COP to be successful, what would that entail from your--
DAVID CALLAWAY: So what we saw in 2015 was the Paris Accord, right? It was-- COP was in Paris. All the countries of the world signed on to an agreement to keep global prices from-- global temperatures from rising too far, right? That was the last time they agreed on anything.
And every year we all go to COP, something like 70,000 people go in this year to Dubai. And everyone's looking for a global agreement and every year it collapses or it's kind of warm toast or something like that. This at least sets the stage that we might see something interesting, either in the agreement to phase down oil, which is good for renewable energy investors or the payment of loss and damages to poorer countries, which is another thing.
You know, I for one am kind of skeptical that you can get hundreds governments in a room to agree on anything. But if you have the two biggest polluters in the world, US and China, agreeing on something, there's room for some optimism.
BRAD SMITH: I mean, when we've spoken with climatologists and even some of the climate economists out there, what they've continued to remind us is that we're coming off of-- or we're still in the midst of but perhaps going to be rounding out one of the hottest years on record during 2023. How does that change the dialogue, the discourse from some of the global world leaders?

ICLN,2023-11-10,Plug Power stock tanks 40% as company warns it could run out of money in a year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plug-power-stock-tanks-40-as-company-warns-it-could-run-out-of-money-in-a-year-155101635.html,"Plug Power (PLUG) stock fell 40% on Friday, closing at $3.53 per share after the hydrogen fuel cell developer posted weaker-than-expected results and issued a ""going concern"" notice regarding its potential inability to fund operations over the next year.
The Latham, N.Y.-based company said in a filing published late Thursday it projects that ""existing cash and available for sale and equity securities will not be sufficient to fund operations through the next 12 months.""
""These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,"" read the filing.
Plug Power, which makes fuel cells and devices that produce hydrogen, posted a loss of $0.47 per share for the third quarter, steeper than the $0.30-per-share loss expected by Wall Street.
Net revenue for the quarter came in at $198.7 million, shy of the $200.2 million expected by analysts. The company's net loss in the quarter totaled $283.5 million.

""This was a difficult quarter,"" CEO Andy Marsh said in prepared remarks during the company's earnings call on Thursday.
""Over the past several months, there have been enormous challenges associated with the availability of hydrogen, primarily due to downed plants, including our Tennessee facility, and temporary plant outages across the entire hydrogen network,"" he added.
Plug Power's CFO, Paul Middleton, played down the ""going concern"" warning and the company's ability to raise financing during the earnings call.
""The language that we've included is oftentimes driven by accounting standards and how you have to evaluate it and manage it,"" he said.
""It's a lot more conservative obviously than what we feel like,"" Middleton added. ""But I have a $5 billion balance sheet that's unlevered. I mean, I really don't have any debt. So, we still are extremely confident about the range of parties and solutions that we're working with.""

ICLN,2023-10-24,Green transition: US sustainable fund losing streak extends to 4 quarters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/green-transition-us-sustainable-fund-losing-streak-extends-to-4-quarters-191317881.html,"Sustainable funds tied to the green transition are on a losing streak.
Investors withdrew $2.7 billion from funds focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in the third quarter, according to a new report from Morningstar. It's the fourth straight quarter these funds saw negative net outflows.
""There have always been multiple drivers of motivation for investors and sustainability-focused funds, some of which I think we would expect to be more durable than others,"" Alyssa Stankiewicz, associate director of sustainability research at Morningstar and the report's author, told Yahoo Finance. ""Perhaps rising energy prices and broader global macroeconomic events over the past year and a half have weakened the rationale for keeping those in the portfolio if you're looking specifically at performance drivers.""
A political backlash against ESG investing — which combines risk factors from carbon emissions to corporate governance to labor disputes under one framework — also didn't help sentiment.
Although investors pulled money from traditional funds as well, the outflows were more significant among those with sustainable labels. Overall US long-term funds contracted by $3.9 billion during the third quarter, representing a mere 0.02% decline. Sustainable funds, meanwhile, fell by 0.85%.
Furthermore, more sustainable funds closed in the third quarter than were opened — the first time this has happened in recent history. Three new sustainable funds were launched during the quarter while 17 others either closed or removed their sustainable mandates, as investors turned their focus to other themes such as options trading, emerging markets, and artificial intelligence.
The decline in sustainable funds and beaten-down clean energy stocks has been especially stark given the boom in the space between the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2022. Assets in sustainable funds fell to $298.8 billion in Q3 of this year, down 17% from the record $358.2 billion in Q1 2021.
The passage of President Biden's landmark climate law over a year ago, which has begun delivering substantial investment in the green transition, was expected to provide another tailwind for clean energy stocks. But some of that optimism has faltered in recent quarters.
""We haven't necessarily seen that play out, which is a bit of a surprise,"" Stankiewicz said about the expected investment boost from the law.

A few funds have been especially hard-hit. The passively managed iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) and the actively managed Parnassus Core Equity fund (PRBLX) saw the greatest outflows of their kind, losing roughly $2.1 billion and $600.7 million, respectively, during the quarter. The largest climate fund, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), has also struggled, losing more than $794.2 million this year.

ITA,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

JETS,2024-10-03,Will Airlines ETFs Gain as Strikes Disrupt US East and Gulf Coast Ports?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-etfs-gain-strikes-disrupt-120000764.html,"On Oct. 1, 2024, dockworkers at U.S. ports along the East Coast and Gulf Coast launched their first major strike in almost 50 years, following the collapse of contract renewal talks. Around 50,000 port workers, represented by the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), initiated the work stoppage after their six-year contract expired on Sept. 30. A resolution has yet to be reached with port management, creating immediate supply-chain disruptions along the Eastern Seaboard from Maine to Texas.
Impact on Supply Chain and Airfreight Sector
Freight forwarder Scan Global Logistics (SGL) has advised customers to continue using ocean bookings but to consider alternative routes, such as shipping through the West Coast followed by overland transport. SGL also recommended customers explore airfreight and sea-air combinations for critical shipments. As port congestion worsens, several carriers have begun imposing strike-related surcharges.
Flexport, another forwarder, warned that each day of the strike could lead to five to 10 days of cargo buildup. Should the strike last more than a week, severe capacity shortages and prolonged backlogs are expected, prompting businesses to shift toward airfreight. This move is likely to lead to a surge in airfreight rates during an already strained peak season.
Judah Levine, Head of Research at Freightos, indicated that shippers are already transitioning from ocean to air cargo, particularly for perishable goods. Although airfreight prices from Latin America and Europe to North America have yet to spike significantly, China-North America rates saw a 9% increase last week, signaling the start of peak season pressures.
The latest TAC Index data shows that global airfreight rates have increased modestly, with the Baltic Air Freight Index up by 2.3% at the end of September. Airlines ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, with global exposure, may get a boost from this scenario. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) JETS rose 8.1% in the past month. Themes Airlines ETF AIRL, which also has global exposure, should be followed closely.
Concerns for Key Industries Due to Port Strike
Container xChange predicts that the strikes will severely disrupt industries such as retail, automotive, and manufacturing, with ripple effects hitting supply chains for months to come. Retailers, in particular, are rushing to secure shipments ahead of the holiday season, while automotive manufacturers reliant on timely parts deliveries face production delays.
Small traders are especially vulnerable, as price surges and delays could leave them stranded with unavailable containers. Many companies are rerouting shipments in anticipation of the strike’s fallout.

JETS,2024-09-10,"U.S. Global Investors Reports $11 Million Revenue in Fiscal 2024, Repurchasing Over $2 Million in Shares While Generating a Strong Shareholder Yield of 9.41%",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-global-investors-reports-11-205800242.html,"SAN ANTONIO, Sept. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Global Investors, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROW) (the “Company”), a registered investment advisory firm with deep expertise in global markets and specialized sectors from gold mining to airlines, today announced operating revenues of approximately $11 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The Company reported net income of $1.3 million, down from $3.1 million in the same period the previous year, largely due to a decrease in advisory fees stemming from lower assets under management (AUM). However, net investment income surged to $2.1 million, a remarkable 578% increase from the prior 12-month period.
For fiscal year 2024, average AUM stood at $1.9 billion, with total AUM nearly $1.6 billion as of June 30, 2024, down from $2.4 billion the year prior.
Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, marked by a prolonged yield curve inversion—where the two-year Treasury yield exceeded the 10-year yield—investor sentiment toward the airline industry has weakened. This inversion, a historical recession signal, lasted for a record-breaking 783 days before reversing.1 The uncertainty surrounding the inversion led many investors to reduce exposure to industries like airlines, which are typically sensitive to economic slowdowns. Despite this, the airline industry’s fundamentals—marked by robust growth in passengers, revenue and cash flow—remained strong, although macroeconomic concerns kept many investors on the sidelines.
Now that the yield curve has normalized, the Company expects a potential shift in market sentiment, as the reversal could signal renewed confidence in future economic stability.
“We can’t control external factors like geopolitics, interest rates, taxes or regulations. However, we do have control over our internal processes, including robust governance, compliance and our smart beta 2.0 approach to developing thematic ETF products, which combines quantitative and fundamental analysis,” says Frank Holmes, CEO of U.S. Global Investors. “While we cannot directly influence investor sentiment, we remain optimistic, particularly following the reversal of the yield curve in September after its historic 783-day inversion. As illustrated in the chart, the correlation between the inverted yield curve and redemptions in the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE: JETS) has been significant.”
Four-Year Period Through September 2024

Confidence in the Long-Term Outlook for the Airline Industry
The Company continues to express confidence in the long-term growth of the airline industry, driven by strong demand for air travel, lower borrowing costs and a return to pre-pandemic levels of consumer travel spending. Two years ago, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was consistently clearing around 2.0 million passengers per day, even surpassing pre-pandemic figures. In July 2024, the TSA set a new record by screening 3 million passengers in a single day.2
Additionally, the Company continues to expand its global presence with a new ETF listing in Colombia this month. Many countries in Latin America are pursuing robust strategies to expand tourism, creating jobs and attracting foreign capital. This strategic move aligns with the Company’s approach to tapping into high-growth markets, where tourism plays a critical role in driving economic development.
Leading U.S. airlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines, experienced an average revenue growth of 841% over the four years ending in June 2024, while EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) grew by 178% over the same period, according to Bloomberg data. Over the past two years, these airlines saw revenue growth of 61%, with EBITDA doubling by 100%, underscoring the resilience and growth of the sector.

9.41% Shareholder Yield Exceeds Treasury Yields
As of the most recent reporting period, the Company’s shareholder yield—a valuation metric popularized by Cambria Funds founder Mebane Faber3—was 9.41%,4 more than double the yields on both five-year and 10-year Treasury bonds. This strong yield reflects the Board of Directors' commitment to delivering value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and monthly dividends.
Share Repurchases and Monthly Dividends
Indeed, the Company is committed to returning value to shareholders. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of 767,651 of its own shares at a net cost of approximately $2.2 million. This marks an 86% jump in shares repurchased from the same period a year earlier and a nearly 760% increase from fiscal 2022.
Fiscal Year End, Three-Year Period

As of June 30, 2024, the Board of Directors has authorized a monthly dividend of $0.0075 per share from July 2024 through September 2024. The Company has paid a monthly dividend since 2007.
Healthy Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2024, the Company had net working capital of approximately $38.2 million, a slight increase from the same period last year. With approximately $27.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, plus investments in our funds and other securities, the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations.
Gold Investors Anticipating Rate Cuts
The price of gold hit a new all-time high price on August 20 of this year,5 yet investment in gold-backed ETFs has remained muted as high interest rates in the U.S. deterred some investors from putting money in a non-interest-bearing asset. However, rates are widely expected to be lowered starting at the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting on September 17, a move that should lower bond yields, weaken the U.S. dollar and potentially boost demand for gold and gold mining stocks.
Against this background, the Company is happy to see that AUM in U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE: GOAU) remained stable between August 2023 and August 2024. We consider GOAU a smart beta 2.0 ETF, meaning we believe it combines the benefits of passive investing and active investing. GOAU provides investors access to companies engaged in the production of precious metals either through active (mining or production) or passive (owning royalties or streams) means.
“De-dollarization, geopolitical tension and concerns over U.S. debt sustainability continue to drive interest in gold,” says Mr. Holmes. “With limited alternatives in other major currencies, central banks have increased their gold reserves, a trend that could continue given expectations of gold continuing to hit new all-time highs.”
JETS UCITS ETF Merged with TRIP
The Company continues to strengthen the global brand of its U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE: JETS), which trades not just in New York but also on the Mexican Stock Exchange, the Lima Stock Exchange in Peru and, effective August 29, 2024, the Colombia Securities Exchange.
In April, the U.S. Global Jets UCITS ETF merged with the Travel UCITS ETF (TRIP) after the Company acquired the fund from HANetf, Europe’s first and only independent, full-service provider of UCITS ETFs.
Whereas JETS invests mostly in the airlines industry, TRIP includes other sectors of the travel industry, such as hotels and cruise line operators. All combined, the global tourism market is expected to generate a massive $2 trillion in revenue in 2024, according to research by IBISWorld.6 This represents 2% of the global economy, estimated at approximately $105 trillion in 2023.7
Tune In to the Earnings Webcast
The Company has scheduled a webcast for 7:30 a.m. Central time on September 11, 2024, to discuss the Company’s key financial results for the fiscal year.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV), may trade at a discount or premium to NAV and are not individually redeemed from the funds. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Because the funds concentrate their investments in specific industries, the funds may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries. The funds are non-diversified, meaning they may concentrate more of their assets in a smaller number of issuers than diversified funds.
The funds invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The funds may invest in the securities of smaller-capitalization companies, which may be more volatile than funds that invest in larger, more established companies.
The performance of the funds may diverge from that of the index. Because the funds may employ a representative sampling strategy and may also invest in securities that are not included in the index, the funds may experience tracking error to a greater extent than funds that seek to replicate an index. The funds are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the index.
Airline Companies may be adversely affected by a downturn in economic conditions that can result in decreased demand for air travel and may also be significantly affected by changes in fuel prices, labor relations and insurance costs. Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, such as China and/or Taiwan, a regional ETFs returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.

Cash flow multiples, also known as valuation multiples, measure the relationship between a company's cash flow and its market value.

JETS,2024-07-04,Gas ETFs Rise Amid Record July 4 Travel,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gas-etfs-rise-amid-record-120000478.html,"Around 71 million people are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home over the Fourth of July holiday, according to AAA.
The forecast, which encompasses “the entire July 4th week, plus the Saturday before and the Sunday after the holiday,” predicts that there will be a 5% increase in travel versus last year.

If the numbers are accurate, it would even represent a gain of 8% versus 2019, the year before Covid hit and decimated the travel industry.

Of those 71 million, AAA projects that a record 60.6 million will travel by car, up 2.8 million from last year and 5.3 million from 2019.

Air travel is also expected to hit a record, with 5.74 million people flying on planes, while other modes of transportation—including buses, cruises and trains—will rise to 4.6 million, but fall short of 2019’s 4.79 million record, according to AAA.

Gasoline futures have been rising recently, perhaps in anticipation of the surge in demand this week. The $105 million United States Gasoline Fund (UGA) rose by 11% over the past month and is up nearly 15% since the start of the year.

However, those gains lag the one-month and year-to-date returns of 13% and 23%, respectively, for the $1.3 billion United States Oil Fund (USO).
JETS Descending
Meanwhile, despite record air travel, the US Global Jets ETF (JETS), with $1.2 billion in assets under management, hasn’t done much. It’s down 2.3% over the past month and up 5% since the start of the year—well below the S&P 500’s 16% gain.

Likewise, the Defiance Hotel Airline and Cruise ETF (CRUZ), which has $29 million in AUM, is flat over the past month and up 3% on a year-to-date basis. 

AAA noted that “with new ships coming onto the market – and going for a premium – some cruise lines have been offering targeted discounts to fill older inventory for remaining cabins.”

JETS,2024-02-08,U.S. Global Investors Reports Strong Results for December Quarter,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-global-investors-reports-strong-210500383.html,"SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Global Investors, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROW) (the “Company”), a registered investment advisory firm with longstanding experience in global markets and specialized sectors from gold mining to airlines, today reported net income of $1.2 million, or $0.09 per share, in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. That was up from a net loss of $176,000, or $0.01 per share, in the previous quarter and represents a 45% increase from the same quarter a year earlier.
The growth in net income was due in large part to a significant increase in net investment income, which was $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net investment income of $116,000 for the same period a year earlier. This increase included net unrealized gains on equity securities of $279,000, compared to net unrealized losses of $937,000 in the comparable period.
Operating revenues during the quarter were $2.8 million, while total assets under management (AUM) at quarter end were $2.1 billion, down from AUM of $2.4 billion a year ago.
“The decline in assets was predominantly driven by the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE: JETS), which saw net outflows in 2023 as many foreign investors cut their exposure to ETFs due, we believe, to fear of a global recession,” says Frank Holmes, the Company’s CEO and Chief Investment Officer.
Strengthening the Moat Around Our Smart Beta 2.0 ETFs
The Company continues to strengthen the economic moat around two of its ETF offerings, JETS and the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE: GOAU). In this context, a moat is a term used to describe a company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals.
In December 2023, GOAU began trading on Peru’s Bolsa de Valores de Lima (Lima Stock Exchange), the ETF’s third international listing after New York City and Mexico City. GOAU joins JETS, which listed in Lima in December 2020. Besides New York and Lima, JETS is also available to buy in Europe, London and Mexico City.
“This move gives even more investors access to GOAU, a dynamic, rules-based ETF that has a distinctive quantitative and fundamental approach to stock-picking that we describe as quantamental,” continues Mr. Holmes. “Like JETS and our U.S. Global Sea to Sky Cargo ETF (NYSE: SEA), GOAU has a smart beta 2.0 construction, meaning it combines the ease of passive investing with the rigor of active investing. The stock selections and weightings in our three ETFs are based on more than simple market caps; a number of key financial factors are also taken into consideration. Each quarter, the ETFs are rebalanced and reconstituted.”
Healthy Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net working capital of approximately $38.3 million, an increase of $840,000 from June 30, 2023. With approximately $27.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, plus investments in our funds and other securities, the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations.
Tune In to the Earnings Webcast
The Company has scheduled a webcast for 7:30 a.m. Central time on Friday, February 9, 2024, to discuss the Company’s key financial results for the quarter. Frank Holmes will be accompanied on the webcast by Lisa Callicotte, chief financial officer, and Holly Schoenfeldt, marketing and public relations manager.

JETS,2023-12-14,U.S. Global Investors Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2024 Fiscal Year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-global-investors-reports-financial-212100052.html,"SAN ANTONIO, Dec. 14, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Global Investors, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROW) (the “Company”), a registered investment advisory firm with longstanding experience in global markets and specialized sectors from gold mining to airlines, today reported operating income of $215,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, on total revenues of $3.1 million. The Company recorded a net loss of $176,000, or $0.01 per share.
Average assets under management (AUM) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, were $2.1 billion, a decrease of $835 million, or 28%, from the same quarter a year earlier.
“The decline in assets was predominantly driven by the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE: JETS), which saw net outflows totaling $668 million from January 2023 to September 2023 as mostly foreign investors, fearing a global recession, cut their exposure to ETFs,” says Frank Holmes, the Company’s CEO and Chief Investment Officer. “However, as I highlight below, trading activity in JETS has improved in the current December quarter as the price of crude oil has fallen below its 200-day moving average; airfare remains strong; and the rate of annual inflation has eased, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may be nearing the end of its monetary tightening policy.”
Total Shareholder Yield, Including Share Repurchases
Shareholder yield is a ratio that shows how much money shareholders receive from a company in the form of cash dividends, net share repurchases and debt reduction. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s shareholder yield was 6.84%.1
During the three-month period, the Company purchased a total of 198,213 class A shares using cash of approximately $611,000. This is almost five times the number of shares that the Company repurchased during the same period a year earlier. The repurchase program has been in place since December 2012. The Company buys back stock on flat or down days.
Global Airline Industry’s Historic Rebound
Nearly four years after the Covid-19 pandemic grounded planes and shocked the industry, Thanksgiving air travel in the U.S. set a new daily record for passenger numbers. On Sunday, November 26, 2023, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened a record 2.9 million passengers, painting a picture of an industry on the cusp of a historic rebound.2
Delta Air Lines reported robust holiday travel demand and increasing corporate bookings, reflecting a bright end to 2023 and solid beginning to 2024. Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference, Delta CEO Ed Bastian doubled down on the carrier’s positive 2023 guidance, citing record revenues for the Thanksgiving holiday. Christmas bookings look to be “very, very strong,” Bastian said.3

Bloomberg, U.S. Global Investors
SAN ANTONIO, Nov. 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Global Investors, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROW) (the “Company”), a registered investment advisory firm with longstanding experience in global markets and specialized sectors from gold to airlines, is pleased to report financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. For the 12-month period, net income was $3.1 million, or $0.22 per share, and operating income was $3.5 million. Operating margin was a healthy 23% on operating revenues of $15.1 million, despite average assets under management (AAUM) declining 35.6%, from $3.9 million during fiscal 2022 to $2.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.
As of June 30, 2023, the Company had net working capital of approximately $37.4 million, over a 10% increase from June 30, 2022. With approximately $25.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $12.9 million in securities recorded at fair value, excluding convertible securities, the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations.
Now that this 10-K is filed, the Company will begin working diligently on the September 10-Q. The 10-Q is typically filed about 45 days after quarter end, and the Company believes it will file the September 30, 2023, 10-Q within 45 days after filing the 10-K.
Enhanced Share Repurchase Program, Monthly GROW Dividends
For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company purchased a total of 91,845 class A shares using cash of $257,000. This is more than double the number of shares that the Company repurchased during the same period a year earlier. The repurchase program has been in place since December 2012, and the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has renewed the repurchase program each calendar year. The Company buys back stock on flat or down days.
The Board has authorized payment of the $0.0075 per share per month dividend beginning in October 2023 and continuing through December 2023. The record dates were October 9, November 13 and December 11, and the payment dates were October 23, November 27 and December 26. Payment of cash dividends is within the discretion of the Board and is dependent on earnings, operations, capital requirements, general financial condition of the Company and general business conditions. Dividends totaling $1.1 million were paid to holders of class A common stock in fiscal year 2023.
JETS Has Remained Resilient in the Face of Negative Sentiment
Fiscal year 2023 was a challenging one for attracting new assets, as investors exercised caution in the face of stubborn inflation, decades-high interest rates, geopolitical risks and recession fears. In the first eight months of 2023, investors pulled more than $90 billion from U.S. stock mutual funds and ETFs, according to Morningstar. Short-term bond funds lost $6 billion in August, extending the selloff to a record 21 months, while commodities funds lost $25 billion in the 12 months ended August 31.

KBWY,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

KBWY,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

KBWY,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

KBWY,2024-10-02,How investors can get in on the China stock rally with ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-china-stock-rally-etfs-172514354.html,"China stocks (^HSI) have extended their rally after the People's Bank of China unveiled new stimulus measures in an effort to recover its struggling economy.
Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.
Watch the video above to hear some of Rosenbluth's ETF plays for the port strike affecting the US's East and Gulf Coasts.

KBWY,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

KBWY,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

KBWY,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

KBWY,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

KBWY,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

KBWY,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window.

KBWY,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

KBWY,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:

2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia

4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

NAIL,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

NAIL,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

NAIL,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

NAIL,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

NAIL,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

NAIL,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

NAIL,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

NAIL,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

NAIL,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs.

If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

NAIL,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

NAIL,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

NAIL,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

QQQM,2024-05-21,Actively Managed and Outcome-Based ETFs Take Center Stage in 2024,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/actively-managed-outcome-based-etfs-120000665.html,"In an interview with etf.com, Giang Bui, Head of U.S. Equities & ETPs at Nasdaq and member of the etf.com editorial advisory board, discussed key trends shaping the ETF landscape in 2024. Bui highlighted the continued dominance of actively managed ETFs, which comprised two-thirds of new launches year-to-date, exceeding even 2023's record pace.
""Active equity makes up about half of new launches,"" Bui noted, reflecting investor appetite for professional stock selection in the current market environment. Outcome-based strategies, designed to achieve specific goals like risk management or income generation, remain a significant driver of innovation.
However, the hottest topic in ETFs this year undoubtedly revolves around Bitcoin. ""It's been really exciting to see all the adoption and how well [the bitcoin ETFs] are trading,"" Bui remarked, emphasizing their operational efficiency and asset accumulation.
Exchanges Facilitate Investor Access
Bui also addressed the crucial role exchanges play in ensuring investor access to ETFs. Nasdaq, boasting over 600 listed ETFs with a combined value of $1 trillion, takes pride in supporting issuers throughout the entire product lifecycle.
""We partner with issuers on ETF education and provide robust liquidity support,"" Bui explained. This commitment translates to a smooth and efficient experience for investors and financial advisors seeking to incorporate ETFs into their portfolios.
Nasdaq Selected as Winner for Index Provider of the Year
On a separate note, Bui expressed enthusiasm about Nasdaq's nomination for etf.com's Index Provider of the Year award. ""We've been in the index space for over 50 years,"" Bui said, acknowledging the recognition from a respected industry publication.
More importantly, Bui emphasized Nasdaq's dedication to supporting issuers who leverage their indexes. ""We're excited to be partnering with them to provide access to strategies about emerging themes and cater to investor demand,"" Bui concluded.
This conversation underscores the dynamism of the ETF industry in 2024. Actively managed and outcome-based options continue to gain traction, while innovative products like bitcoin ETFs capture investor imagination. With continued exchange support, investors can expect an even more robust and accessible ETF landscape in the years to come.

QQQM,2024-05-17,Invesco Prioritizes ETF Innovation and Shareholder Focus,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-prioritizes-etf-innovation-shareholder-120000698.html,"The 2024 etf.com Awards were a night of recognition for the ETF industry's best and brightest, and Invesco had a lot to celebrate with two ETFs nominated for the prestigious ETF of the Year award. Lucy Brewster had the opportunity to interview Factor & Core Equity Strategist, Chris Dahlin, to discuss his thoughts on the evening and the future of the ETF industry.
Dahlin's excitement centered around the ETF of the Year category, where two Invesco products, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) and the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM), were nominated. ""The fact that these two very different ETFs are both recognized,"" Dahlin observed, ""reinforces the idea that the award isn't just about past performance, but about how well an ETF meets the needs of investors and complements their portfolios.""
When asked about the industry trends reflected in the awards ceremony, Dahlin pointed to a key theme: the evolution of established indices. ""We're seeing a shift beyond traditional long-only exposure,"" he explained. ""New products are leveraging derivatives to offer exposure to popular indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, but with additional features like income generation, downside protection, or defined outcomes.
Looking toward the future, Dahlin expressed optimism about the industry's continued focus on shareholder well-being. ""Even as the ETF industry experiences tremendous growth,"" he remarked, ""there's a commitment to prioritizing investor outcomes. New product development reflects this focus, with ETFs designed to address specific investor needs and desires.""
Dahlin's message resonated with the night's overall spirit of recognizing innovation that benefits investors. As the ETF industry marches forward, it seems clear that a focus on shareholder value will remain a core principle.

QQQM,2024-04-30,Amazon ETFs in Focus Ahead of Key Earnings Report,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-etfs-focus-ahead-key-120000941.html,"Two of the Magnificent Seven will announce earnings this week, starting with Amazon.com Inc., which reports after the bell today.
The e-commerce and cloud giant is anticipated to have made $0.83 per share in earnings during the first quarter and $142.6 billion in revenues.
Investors are eager to see whether the company echoes comments made by Microsoft, when it announced its earnings last week, about strong demand for AI-powered products.
Amazon Web Services is the number one provider of cloud computing services, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure, but the latter has a reputation for being ahead when it comes to AI.
Additionally, investors will be interested to know whether Amazon’s original e-commerce business continued to grow double-digits in Q1 like it did in Q4.
Though it has elements of both a retailer and technology company, Amazon is classified as a consumer discretionary stock under the Global Industry Classification Standard.
It’s the largest holding by far in the $19 billion Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY), where it has a 24.1% weighting currently.
Bullish Analysts
Analysts are mostly bullish on Amazon with Mizuho saying that “Amazon is our top pick due to the positive ecommerce checks and accelerating AWS trends.” Mizuho has a $230 price target on the stock.
Meanwhile, analysts at Needham, who have a $205 price target on the shares, said that it expects Amazon’s cost-cutting actions from last year to “drive margin expansion throughout 2024.”
They also believe that the company has a “best-in-class strategic position related to Generative A.I.”
“AMZN is developing GenAI chips to train and drive better inferences from LLMs (large language models), AND it has the widest variety of choices related to LLMs, because it offers a captive O&O (owned & operated) LLM, and it also hosts dozens of other LLMs of various sizes.
This is a unique strategic position, and since digital markets have ‘winner take most’ economics, we are optimistic that AMZN will be one of the 2-3 winners from GenAI,” the analysts wrote in a recent research note.

QQQM,2024-04-26,ETF Spotlight: Invesco QQQM Outshines QQQ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etf-spotlight-invesco-qqqm-outshines-120000066.html,"The $22.2 billion Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQM) stood out as one of the bright spots in the Invesco Ltd. first-quarter earnings report this week, which highlighted the 4-year-old fund for its $2.8 billion worth of net inflows.
But let’s not forget about the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), the $245 billion flagship that took in $9.1 billion during the quarter, or more than three times the inflows of QQQM.
It comes down to revenue generation and QQQ doesn’t generate a dime for Invesco.
The distinction between the two ETFs is both interesting and subtle and underscores the hit Invesco suffered in the first quarter when the realities of lower management fees contributed to a decline in quarterly profits at the $1.6 trillion Atlanta-based asset manager.
That brings us to the anomaly of QQQ, which is more than 10 times the size of QQQM and is 33% more expensive at 20 basis points yet contributes nothing to Invesco’s bottom line.
QQQ, QQQM: Mag 7 Exposure
Invesco executives and representatives are keen to boast of the marketing benefits of a high-profile ETF like QQQ, which, like QQQM, offers easy exposure to the popular Magnificent Seven stocks. But the unit investment trust structure of QQQ, dating to its launch in 1999, means the expense ratio is essentially split between the provider of the underlying index, Nasdaq, and the trustee of the ETF, Bank of New York Mellon.
Doubling down on the positive spin of a giant ETF that isn’t generating any profits for the issuer, a company spokesperson described QQQ as among the most liquid equity ETFs in the world, which is used as a trading vehicle for the largest institutions.
A company spokesperson described QQQ, which is a trading vehicle for major financial institutions, as among the world's most liquid equity ETFs.
For the more fee conscious, longer-term investor, the edge goes to QQQM, which gained 36.02% over the past 12 months, compared to a 35.89% gain for QQQ over the same period.

RETL,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

RETL,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

RETL,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

RETL,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

RETL,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

RETL,2024-09-30,"Labor market in focus, port strike looms ahead: Morning Brief",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/labor-market-focus-port-strike-165636574.html,"On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills analyze the market open and discuss some of the biggest stories of the trading day.
All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

RETL,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

RETL,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

RETL,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

RETL,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index.

If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

RETL,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

RETL,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

SPYD,2024-09-05,Market Rotation Fuels Diverse ETF Outperformance in August,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-rotation-fuels-diverse-etf-223451834.html,"A diverse mix of ETFs outperformed in August, reflecting a potential shift in investor sentiment and market dynamics.
According to data from Morningstar Direct, the top-performing ETFs for the month included strategies focused on dividends, value, and low volatility, alongside some momentum plays.
Rob Isbitts, founder of research firm Sungarden Investment Publishing and an etf.com contributor, described August as “a tale of three parts” that contributed to the eclectic mix of top performers.
“There was that sudden drop in the first couple days of the month, which probably was a shock,” Isbitts said. “And then you had this knee-jerk, instant reaction.”
He noted that from Aug. 5 to Aug. 19, the S&P 500 rose about 8% in just two weeks, an unusually strong move. This volatility created opportunities for various strategies to outperform.
Dividend, Low Volatility Strategies Lead
Several top-performing ETFs focused on high dividend or low volatility strategies. The $6.6 billion SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD) gained 4.5% in August, according to Morningstar Direct. It was joined by the $4 billion Invesco S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (SPHD), which returned 4.8% for the month.
“People were either going for yield, or they were going for value, or they were going for both,” Isbitts said, explaining the appeal of these strategies. “There were three factors: dividend was one, value was another, low volatility was another.”
Morningstar Direct data shows that the $802 million SPDR SSGA U.S. Large Cap Low Volatility Index ETF (LGLV) also made the top 10 list, returning 4.5% in August, further highlighting the strong performance of low volatility strategies.
Despite the shift toward defensive strategies, momentum-based ETFs also performed well. The SPDR SSGA U.S. Large Cap Low Volatility Index ETF (SEIM) led with a 5.5% return in August, Morningstar Direct reported.
“I believe it was a little bit of a happy medium,” Isbitts said, suggesting this performance might be due to a more balanced approach. “That’s the thing with ETFs. We said, okay, we're going to use a momentum factor. It kind of means you’re chasing the past, and it works.”
SEIM vs SPY Performance
The $280 million Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (GVIP), which tracks popular hedge fund holdings, also made the top 10 list, returning 4.4% in August, according to Morningstar Direct.
Other notable performers include the $271 million ETC 6 Meridian Mega Cap Equity ETF (SIXA) and the $804 million ALPS O’Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (OUSA), which gained 4.2% and 3.95% respectively.

SPYD,2024-04-15,What ETFs Performed Well Last Time Inflation Jumped?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etfs-performed-well-last-time-120000412.html,"It takes a lot for a bit of market history to surprise me. But when researching what ETFs allowed advisors to make money for their clients the last time inflation spiked, I admit I was surprised.
This work is critical for advisors following Wednesday’s troubling Consumer Price Index report. The monthly CPI release showed that inflation is not going away as quickly as we had hoped. At 3.5% over the past 12 months (and 3.8% excluding food and energy), the Wall Street chatter has gone from how many times the Fed will cut rates in 2024 to whether they will cut at all.
When I was an advisor, identifying and communicating possible “escape routes” from threats like an inflation resurgence made a difference. Still, with inflation, there’s simply not much to go on historically.
Until the year over year CPI started to accelerate around this time in 2021, some time had passed since advisors dealt with that type of retirement planning hurdle for clients. However, the days of assuming 2% inflation far into the future are over, at least for a while. And simply relying on what asset classes were good inflation fighters back in the 1970s, the last time we saw sustained price pressures like this, is futile. Markets are too different now.
Choosing the Best ETF Inflation Fighters
Like many in the investment advisory community, I like to try to solve problems. Investment decision-making problems, in particular. This is why ETFs are such a great companion in cases like this. Here’s what I did to try to answer the question, “what helped fight inflation the last time?”
The last time, as I see it, was the 12-month period from April 30, 2021, to that same date in 2022. So, the same time of year we now are in. I found that the 12-month CPI went from 4.16% (not very far from the latest data released this week) to 8.26%. So, inflation on a year-over-year basis doubled, or rose by more than 4%, if one prefers to look at it that way. Even if we don’t get that type of chaotic move, it seems a good idea for advisors to at least be prepared, just in case.
Turning to the most familiar investment types was not the answer. SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) was up…by a whopping 0.04%! And the Invesco Equal Weight 0-30 Years Treasury ETF (GOVI), essentially a bond ladder in a single ticker, fell 9.6% including the income shareholders received. So, the answer was not simple here.
Which ETFs Did Well During the Last Inflation Scare?
While traditional stocks and bonds did not do well during that prior period, commodities did. That’s not a huge surprise, since inflation is synonymous with commodity price increases So commodity ETFs did well, including the $5 billion Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K1 ETF (PDBC), which has the added perk of skipping the K-1 tax form that comes with most commodity ETFs. Perhaps that helps make up for the length of the fund’s name! Inflation doubled during that period, but PDBC jumped too, up 54% from April-end 2021 to April-end 2022.

SSO,2024-09-04,Tradr Debuts Leveraged ETFs for Longer-Term Investors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tradr-debuts-leveraged-etfs-longer-120000156.html,"For the first time since leveraged ETFs were introduced in 2006, investors and financial advisors can justify holding the aggressive strategies for more than one day at a time.
This week the Tradr ETF brand of AXS Investments rolled out eight leveraged ETFs that reset monthly and weekly as opposed to the traditional daily reset strategies that can trip up longer-term investors.
Whether the longer reset periods gain appeal among active traders and investors who are already holding the daily-reset ETFs longer than designers expected remains uncertain.
“We’re targeting active traders and fiduciaries who are not allowed to use daily ETFs because of the daily reset,” said Matt Markiewicz, head of product and capital markets at Tradr ETFs in New York.
Math Adds Up for Longer-Reset Leveraged ETFs
In addition to potentially capturing a slice of the financial advisor market that might be able to check the suitability box, Markiewicz said the longer reset periods will benefit investors who tend to hold the daily-reset strategies a week or longer.
The math adds up in favor of longer-reset ETFs for investors intent on sitting in the short-term strategies. But possibly the biggest advantage about resetting the leverage on a weekly and monthly basis, as opposed to daily, is that investors will be able to compare and contrast their leveraged exposure in these slightly nuanced strategies.
Will Longer-Term Leveraged ETFs Catch On?
“This takes the pressure off having to worry about getting out quickly,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
“The one worry I have is whether it will increase the amount of rank speculation among retail investors, but I’m not here to judge,” he added.
The Tradr suite includes: the Tradr 2X Long SPY Weekly (SPYB), the Tradr 2X Long SPY Monthly (SPYM), the Tradr 2X Long Triple Q Weekly (QQQW), the Tradr 2X Long Triple Q Monthly (MQQQ), the Tradr 2X Long SOXX Weekly (SOXW) and the Tradr 2X Long SOXX Monthly (SOXM).
There are also single stock versions. The Tradr 1.75X Long NVDA Weekly (NVDW) and the Tradr 1.5X TSLA Weekly (TSLW).
“The smart thing is, they’re picking really popular ETFs to leverage,” Balchunas said. “This is the eye of the hurricane when it comes to volume, and that gives Tradr a fighting chance of success.”
One of the issues the longer resets aim to solve is the tracking error that can develop when daily-reset ETFs are held for longer time periods.
For example, the ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF (SSO), which offers two times daily exposure to the S&P, is up 30.5% this year, which compares to a 17.1% gain for the S&P.

TNA,2024-05-17,"Profiting in Small-Caps Whether They Go Up, Down, or Remain Flat",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/profiting-small-caps-whether-down-134200117.html,"It’s not often that we can make money even when our underlying investment goes down in price.
But one simple option strategy has the power to do just that. In fact, this strategy has consistently produced above-average returns with relatively low risk.
Before we delve into the strategy itself, let’s review some option basics.
Option Basics – A Refresher
There is no need to worry about complex mathematical formulas or equations. Over the years I’ve found that the more complicated a strategy is, the less likely it will work over the long-term. We want to employ a strategy that has a history of profitability and is easy to follow.
Options are standardized contracts that give the buyer the right – but not the obligation – to buy or sell the underlying stock at a fixed price which is known as the strike price. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a stock, fund, or index, while a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the same. The investor who purchases an option (whether a put or call) is the option buyer, while the investor who sells a put or call is the seller or writer.
Options consist of time value and intrinsic value. In-the-money options consist of both components. At-the-money and out-of-the-money options consist only of time value. At options expiration, options lose all time value. When we are short an option, the time value of that option becomes profit at expiration regardless of the price movement of the underlying stock or ETF.
Become Your Own Bank
Most investors are not familiar with the concept of selling option premium to generate cash income. Selling option premium is a very simple but lucrative income strategy. When you sell an option, cash equal to the premium is immediately credited to your brokerage account.
Unlike a traditional stock dividend, you don’t have to own the stock on the dividend date to receive a quarterly dividend and you don’t have to wait a year to receive a 2% or 3% annual dividend yield.
The key to selling option premium to generate cash income is to make sure the option you sell is ‘covered’. In this example, we’ll be using what is known as a buy-write or covered call strategy. In this strategy, we buy in increments of 100 shares of a stock or ETF and sell a related call option. As options cover 100 shares of the underlying security, we want to make sure that we sell 1 call option for every 100 shares purchased.
Weekly covered calls are initiated by buying 100 shares of a stock and selling 1 weekly call option. As noted previously, when you sell an option, cash equal to the option premium sold is immediately credited to your brokerage account. This cash credit reduces the cost basis of the stock and reduces the overall risk of the trade. The great advantage to selling weekly calls is that you get to sell 52 options a year.

URA,2024-06-17,Uranium ETFs: How to Play Bill Gates’ Nuclear Energy Bet,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uranium-etfs-play-bill-gates-211500105.html,"Bill Gates is betting on the future of nuclear energy as his next generation nuclear power plant, TerraPower, started construction last week.
While his company is privately held, exchange-traded fund investors can gain exposure to nuclear energy’s growth potential with uranium ETFs.
Nuclear power plants use controlled nuclear fission of enriched uranium to generate heat that boils water to create steam and spin turbines for electricity.
Gates’ next generation nuclear power plant uses liquid sodium, which has a boiling point eight times higher than water’s. So, according to Gates, “it can absorb all the extra heat generated in the nuclear core,” limiting temperatures that might cause a meltdown.
After last week’s groundbreaking event in Kemmerer, Wyo., Gates remarked in his blog that he expects the site “will soon be the bedrock of America’s energy future” and that the move represents “the biggest step yet toward safe, abundant, zero-carbon energy.”
Why Is Nuclear Energy Trending?
Nuclear energy is trending amid escalating climate change concerns and geopolitical tensions, highlighting the need to shift toward clean energy resources and energy independence.
Climate change concerns: As countries strive to reduce carbon emissions, nuclear power is gaining renewed attention as a clean energy source producing minimal greenhouse gases during operation.
Energy security: Volatile oil prices amid the Russia-Ukraine and Israeli-Palestinian wars have highlighted the importance of energy independence. Nuclear power plants use domestic uranium fuel, offering a secure energy source compared to relying on imported fossil fuels.
Nuclear Energy and Uranium ETFs
There are several nuclear energy ETFs available to investors. These funds invest in companies involved in the entire nuclear energy industry, from uranium mining to nuclear power plant construction and operation. Here are a few examples:
VanEck Uranium & Nuclear ETF
The VanEck Uranium & Nuclear ETF (NLR) tracks the MVIS Global Uranium & Nuclear Energy Index, which includes companies involved in uranium mining, nuclear facility construction and maintenance, and nuclear electricity generation.
Global X Uranium ETF
The Global X Uranium ETF (URA) primarily focuses on uranium mining companies but also includes some companies involved in other parts of the nuclear energy sector.
Sprott Uranium Miners ETF
The Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) focuses on companies that mine uranium, with some investment in uranium exploration and development companies.
Bottom Line on Investing in Uranium ETFs
Investors can potentially benefit from uranium ETFs through an increase in the underlying share prices of companies involved in the nuclear energy industry, driven by factors like rising uranium prices or growing demand for nuclear power.

URA,2024-05-28,Defiance Launches the First 2X Leveraged Uranium ETF (URAX),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defiance-launches-first-2x-leveraged-090000263.html,"URAX seeks 2X the daily performance of uranium mining and nuclear related stocks
URAX The Defiance Daily Target 2X Long Uranium ETF
URAX seeks 2X the daily performance of uranium mining and nuclear related stocks.
MIAMI, May 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance, a leading provider of ETFs, is proud to announce the launch of a groundbreaking leveraged ETF - the Defiance Daily Target 2X Long Uranium ETF - marking a significant advancement in the investment landscape for tactical traders.
We believe the unveiling of URAX represents a pivotal moment in the realm of commodities trading. With a relentless focus on innovation, Defiance is revolutionizing the sector by offering investors unparalleled opportunities to potentially capitalize on the transformative power of nuclear energy.
URAX is poised to capitalize on a potential global shift towards nuclear power as a clean, reliable, and efficient energy source. With increasing demand for uranium- driven by the expansion of nuclear power generation worldwide and growing recognition of its role in combating climate change, URAX provides traders with leveraged exposure to this burgeoning market.
Commenting on the launch, Sylvia Jablonski, Chief Executive Officer at Defiance ETFs, stated, ""We are thrilled to introduce URAX, the first leveraged ETF in uranium. This ETF reflects our commitment to providing investors with innovative opportunities to capitalize on emerging trends and disruptive technologies. With URAX, traders can now leverage the potential of nuclear energy.”
About Defiance ETFs
Founded in 2018, Defiance stands as a leading ETF issuer dedicated to income and thematic investing.
Our suite of first-mover leveraged & thematic ETFs empowers investors to express targeted views on disruptive innovations, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing, while our actively managed options ETFs are designed to seek high income with lower volatility.
Important Disclosures
The fund attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to two times (200%) the share price performance of an underlying exchange-traded fund (an ""Underlying Security""). The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund is very different from most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.
The Fund’s investment adviser will not attempt to position a Fund's portfolio to ensure that the Fund does not gain or lose more than a maximum percentage of its net asset value on a given trading day. As a consequence, if an Underlying Security's share price referenced by a Fund decreases by more than 50% on a given trading day, the corresponding Fund's investors could lose all of their money.
The Fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective for a period other than a single trading day.

URA,2024-04-22,Change Is Never Easy: New Global X CEO,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/change-never-easy-global-x-212319440.html,"Ryan O’Connor
Eleven days into his tenure as the chief executive officer of Global X ETFs, Ryan O’Connor is more focused on the future of the $47 billion asset management firm than the recent past, which includes a raft of executive-level departures since November.
For example, he cites the $3.1 billion worth of net flows this year that have already surpassed the $2.3 billion worth of net flows for all of last year as evidence of a receptive market.
But O’Connor, 40, who joined Global X from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, acknowledges that the direction of the company now will factor in some of its missteps before he arrived.
“Change is never easy, but I really see it as a natural evolution of the platform,” O’Connor told etf.com during his first media interview since joining Global X.
That change, which unfolded prior to the announced hiring of O’Connor in late February includes departures by Chief Investment Officer Jon Maier, head of finance Ronnie Riven, chief executive Luis Berruga, Chief Operating Officer John Belanger, head of human resource Crystal Christy and Bruno Stein, who led a small operation in Brazil.
The departures were a blend of voluntary and involuntary, and in some cases may have been tied to management shortcomings from basic things, including a stagnant model portfolio business and more than a dozen ETFs launched over the past few years that failed to reach the $10 million mark.
In January, Global X closed 19 ETFs, cutting its total lineup to 91. The closed funds included an eclectic mix of strategies focused on China, Pakistan, healthcare, real estate and cannabis.
Global X also pulled its filing for a spot bitcoin ETF, potentially missing out of inflows that have poured into that category since the ETFs were approved in January.
“A lot of times when the people who are entrepreneurial cash out and leave, the company is just not the same,” said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas referring to the 2018 acquisition of Global X by Korean global financial conglomerate Mirae Asset Global Investments.
One of Mirae’s first moves as owner of what was then a $10.2 billion ETF shop was to install Berruga as CEO. The investment looked like a homerun by 2021 when the appeal of thematic strategies brought in $21 billion, doubling the size of Global X.
But Berruga was fired in November 2023 and Thomas Park, co-CEO of Mirae’s U.S. business, was installed as Global X’s interim CEO.
Mirae responded to a request for comment with the following emailed statement, “We have seen significant momentum and innovation coming out of Global X. In order to maintain that momentum and take the brand to the next level, we made a decision to refocus the company's strategic direction. Given his significant ETF experience and insights, Ryan is playing a key role in that evolution.”

URA,2024-04-16,"Global X Exits, Closures Raise Questions Over Future",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-x-exits-closures-raise-214336520.html,"Questions are mounting about the future of Global X ETFs, after the $47 billion ETF issuer lost a handful of senior executives in recent months while cutting its fund lineup.
Chief investment officer Jon Maier and head of finance Ronnie Riven are both stepping down, The Wall Street Journal recently reported. Since November, the New York-based company lost chief executive Luis Berruga, chief operating officer John Belanger, head of human resources Crystal Christy and Bruno Stein, who led operations in Brazil, The Journal said.
Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas questioned whether executives are being forced out or leaving on their own.
“They’re losing all of their ETF people,” Balchunas said in an interview. “I don’t know anyone there anymore, and that’s bad because I get around. They don’t pitch stories or even send out press releases anymore.”
Global X, which brought on Ryan O'Connor as its new CEO on April 8, emailed a statement in response to a request for comment that reads in part, “Recent statements made about Global X are baseless and without merit. When we parted ways with the former CEO, we knew there would be additional changes and we expect more to come as we position ourselves for the future.”
“Ryan’s nearly two decades of industry experience and direct role in innovative product development weighed heavily in our decision to appoint him as CEO,” the statement continued.
In January, Global X closed 19 ETFs, cutting its total lineup to 90. The closed funds were small and included a mixture of strategies focused on China, Pakistan, healthcare, real estate and cannabis.
Trimming unprofitable ETFs from a lineup is common across the industry. Still, at the end of January Global X withdrew its application with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot bitcoin ETF, just weeks after 11 such funds had been approved and went on to pull in billions in inflows.
A company spokesperson emailed at the time that a spot bitcoin ETF “is not a current priority for the business.”
A leader in organic growth just three years ago when thematic strategies were riding high, Global X’s inflows over the past 12 months were $4.2 billion, “which is pretty weak for them,” Balchunas said.
Global X was acquired by Korean asset management conglomerate Mirae Asset Global Investments in 2018, when Global X had $10.2 billion under management. Its largest fund is the $8.2 billion Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which launched in 2013.
Mirae did not respond to a request for comment for this story, but on its website it claims more than 500 ETF products that combine for more than $80 billion globally.

Great to have you here once again with us, Cinthia First and foremost, the commodities ETFs-- how much of a bid are they catching now that we're seeing some of these new all time highs or the new highs in gold?
CINTHIA MURPHY: Hi, Brad. They're finally hitting everybody's radar. I mean, as you know, people look to commodities when they're trying to hedge against inflation, when we're looking to diversify portfolios. But in the last year or so, it's been all about big tech. So people have paid very little attention to the diversifiers because everybody was trying to ride that tech wave.
And this year, that's starting to change. So we're seeing a bit under commodities, we're seeing a lot more commentary from the market experts, the analysts, about the importance of commodities and the opportunity in commodities, which has been a segment that's typically under owned in the advisory channel, it's under owned by most investors. And it's at an attractive positions right now because they're so overlooked so often, especially in the middle of a tech craze. So this has been an interesting moment for these types of investments right now.
- It's particularly interesting, especially given some of the concerns that we've had really murmuring about now, and a loud murmur, about the economy and the likelihood of a recession and where that has actually perhaps fueled some demand for assets like gold. How have you been evaluating that?

URA,2023-12-19,Uranium ETF (URA) Hits New 52-Week High,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uranium-etf-ura-hits-52-120000233.html,"For investors seeking momentum, Global X Uranium ETF URA is probably on radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up 65.4% from its 52-week low price of $18.31/share.
But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed:
URA in Focus
The underlying Solactive Global Uranium & Nuclear Components Total Return Index seeks to track the price movements in shares of companies which are active in the uranium industry. The fund has allocations to the energy and industrial sectors, with share of 61.8% and 18.6%, respectively. The product charges 69 bps in annual fees (See: all Materials ETFs here).
Why the Move?
The upbeat outlook in the sector results from growing interest in nuclear energy, which has led several developed nations to invest in new infrastructure projects while extending the operational life of their existing nuclear power stations. The ongoing energy issues and the requirement for dependable, environmentally friendly energy sources are helping in the sector’s upsurge.
The latest COP-28 powered the ETF. At COP28, delegates from around 200 countries reached an agreement to initiate the reduction of global fossil fuel consumption, signifying a critical step in reducing the worst effects of climate change and the ultimate departure from the era of oil dependence.
Driven by robust market demand and bright prospects, according to carbon credits, the uranium spot price hit its 15-year peak, reaching $85 per pound, supporting analyst estimates for a future market rally in the metal’s price.
More Gains Ahead?
It seems like the fund will remain strong, with a positive weighted alpha of 56.50, which gives cues of a further rally.

Meanwhile, Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist, breaks down the pros and cons between buying now and waiting. ""Now we're at that seasonal slowdown sweet spot for buyers. So there's less competition which can make it easier to snag a deal on a home. At the same time, you might see lower rates if you wait into the spring.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

XLP,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

CFRA Research senior equity research analyst Arun Sundaram notes that more defensive sectors tend to do well in September, so there is some seasonality at play.

Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari joins Catalysts to discuss the current state of the equity market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) and how investors can best position their portfolios heading into 2025.
""I think you have to take a broader look at where we think the market's going over the next six or seven weeks, just because we're in that seasonally weak time in the market, August through October. I think that the August lows of 5,116 [for the S&P 500] are likely going to be tested again, which means that as a long-term investor, you just need to be a little bit cautious,"" Polcari tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to Nvidia (NVDA) as a buying opportunity since shares are down about 25% since its June high. He does not expect the stock to rally back up to its high, but rather, he sees it as ""on sale"" for long-term investors.
""Now, if you're worried about further downside for the broader market and you think it's going to get dragged with it, well then just sit back a little bit and wait. I think, you know, for most of the clients, that's the conversation I'm having, just about being patient, because patience, in this case, could be a virtue,"" he adds.

Polcari argues, ""We're at the very infancy stages of AI. I think Nvidia sits at the nexus of this tech revolution that's happening."" He expects more volatility in the stock as the AI race continues. However, in the long term, he views Nvidia as ""a core name and a core portfolio.""
As the consumer discretionary sector (XLY) leads the market's charge for a rebound in Tuesday's trading session, Polcari is more bullish on consumer staples (XLP): ""I think we're already seeing consumers run into problems. We're seeing people live on credit cards, and discretionary is just that — it's discretionary spending. Those are wants versus needs. So I would be cautious on that sector at the moment, and I'd be more focused on the staples sector. While it's boring... I think it plays nicely in an environment where you think it's going to be a little bit of a pressure on the broader market and on the consumer.""

""We're coming off the back end of a pretty long inflation battle here with rates being at historic peaks. And, you know, you look at the underlying macro data that we're staring at every day, and it's not exceptional, but it's not bad either. It's just kind of in this middling phase. And certainly a much better start to this week than we had last week,"" McGrath explains.
He argues that the Fed's cuts will not immediately come to the rescue as its cuts will likely ""take time to work through."" He adds, ""I don't think you have to look much further than a lot of the numbers we've seen from the consumer discretionary companies, where they're slashing forecast because the demand just isn't there like it has been.

While inflation is down, he argues, ""the problem is there's 20 to 30% built up in there that's still increasing on a month-over-month basis. And it's just the consumer's got to get tapped out at some point. And I'm not saying that's like a death and destruction phase coming, but you are starting to see inklings of that."" However, easing rates should help counter that issue.
Moving forward, McGrath believes the equities market ""could be a bit rocky,"" so investors should take more of a defensive approach and take a position in sectors like industrials (XLI), utilities (XLU), healthcare (XLV), real estate (XLRE), and consumer staples (XLP). He also recommends semiconductors, calling them ""the new industrial."" On the fixed-income side, he argues that ""it's probably time to start taking some duration there"" as the Fed kicks off its rate easing cycle.

SoFi head of investment strategy Liz Young Thomas joins Morning Brief to discuss the market's reaction to the data and how investors can best position their portfolios as the Federal Reserve begins its rate-easing cycle.
Thomas notes that ""equities are still cheering for the beginning of this rate-cutting cycle"" as the Fed eyes a soft landing. She explains that easing rates will likely benefit cyclical areas of the market, like small caps (^RUT), financials (XLF), real estate (XLRE), and industrials (XLI). However, she warns that ""it would be premature to assume that we have secured a soft landing.""
Investors should still have some exposure to areas of the market that benefit from a steepening yield curve. Thomas points to gold (GC=F) as a good option as the global currency is experiencing volatility.

As all eyes are on Friday's August jobs report, Thomas believes that if the data comes in cooler than expected, the market will react negatively and will likely experience a sell-off of mega-cap names. She adds that utilities are ""not just a purely defensive play"" at this stage, as they are a beneficiary of the AI trade. In addition, she explains that consumer staples (XLP) — another traditional defensive play — are overbought currently. If economic data continues to cool during the Fed's cutting cycle, she expects financials and real estate to continue to slow.

The retail sector (XRT) and tech sector (XLK) being among the spaces that saw a mixed bag of results from its top players.
MarketGauge.com chief strategist Michele Schneider joins Market Domination to give insight into what investors need to know about the current market environment following earnings, underlining how best to trade on technicals from each of these industries.
Schneider explains the consumer play as retailers deliver winning or lagging quarterly results amid price-conscious shoppers, while the retail sector is ""very close to a major breakout.""
Turning to tech, Schneider details hidden opportunities to watch and how investors should be ""treading water."" She names Eli Lilly (LLY) as one other stock that is ""treading water"" but in a different manner than tech. Eli Lilly could potentially see $150 to $200 more in this stock coming up, Schneider says.

The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are slipping as recession fears trigger a widespread sell-off among investors. However, Fort Washington Investment Advisors co-chief investment officer Chris Shipley believes the current downturn shouldn't cause investor panic. He notes the market had ""a certain vulnerability"" due to expectations of economic growth and lower inflation. Yet, there turned out to be ""a little more economic weakness than the market was banking on,"" indicating the economy is entering ""a more substantial slowdown."" He views the current situation as an ideal buying opportunity, pointing to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which hasn't seen low share prices since March or April, noting: ""When stocks are on sale, it's time to start taking a look.""

Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry argues that the market has been ""a little bit overdue for a pullback like this."" Amid the sell-off, he encourages investors to focus on companies with high-quality balance sheets, multiple revenue streams, low levels of debt, and good cash flow metrics. He points to consumer staples (XLP) as good investment opportunities.
Some investors are concerned about the pullback's effects on their long-term retirement investments. Vanguard senior wealth advisor Cassandra Rupp, CFP, says, ""We can only control what we can control,"" and breaks down some of the biggest mistakes when managing 401(k) plans: ""Everyone's time horizon can be different. I mean, if we're speaking to some of this reporting in 401(k)'s for retirement savings, depends on what stage of your career you're at. We're seeing an increase in participant deferral rates above 4% now. So we're seeing more and more individuals start to automatically save out of their paychecks into these types of plans.""
Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Kerry Hannon adds that if you're investing in a retirement account, you will experience periods where you're buying high and periods where you're buying low. In the end, it'll most likely even out.
In response to recent signs of economic weakness, Wall Street is convinced the Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut rates by 50 basis points at their September meeting. However, with investors believing the Fed may be delayed in rate reductions, speculation is growing about a potential cut even sooner. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jennifer Schonberger breaks down the details, discussing how the Fed can implement rate cuts outside of their scheduled meetings and historical trends that prompted emergency rate cuts.

Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry joins Wealth! to break down the movement and how investors can best navigate the sell-off.
""The market's been a little bit overdue for a pullback like this,"" Mulberry argues. Amid the sell-off, he encourages investors to focus on companies with high-quality balance sheets, multiple revenue streams, low levels of debt, and good cash flow metrics. He points to consumer staples (XLP) as good investment opportunities, highlighting names like Walmart (WMT) and Coca-Cola (KO) since ""being concentrated on quality is how you're going to survive this particular sell down in the market.""
As major tech stocks have dipped amid the global market sell-off, Mulberry believes that the companies actually monetizing AI will be in a better standing among competitors.
""The dividing line is going to be, 'what is your business model?' There's been an enormous amount of investment from all of those companies in this type of technology. But who's actually closing the loop and generating revenue from AI?"" he explains. He points to Microsoft (MSFT) as one of those names as it generates revenue from its subscription service that allows users to access ChatGPT through the Microsoft Office suite.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer joins Asking for a Trend to discuss his takeaways from the trading day.
First, he points to the continued broadening of the market as a major trend. Energy (XLE), financials (XLF), and industrials (XLI) all led the market's rally while tech (XLP) came in just shy of the S&P 500 over the last five days.
Next, the Russell 2000 (^RUT) hit its highest level since 2022. As more economic data points to cooling inflation, confidence grows in the potential for a September rate cut, giving small caps a boost.
Finally, the economy is showing signs of overall moderation. As June's retail sales report is set to be released on Tuesday, Wall Street is expecting sales to fall about 0.2%. Schafer explains that if the print comes in line with expectations, it would serve as yet another data point showing that the economy is responding to higher interest rates. This would also give the Federal Reserve more confidence in initiating an interest rate cut.

XLP,2024-05-20,ETF Investors Shrugging Off Geopolitical Issues,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etf-investors-shrugging-off-geopolitical-195959471.html,"ETF investors continue showing resilience despite ongoing economic obstacles, according to a new report from CFRA.
An analysis of investor flow patterns showed evidence of optimism even against the backdrop of a 4% decline by the S&P 500 Index in April, as well as increasing global geopolitical unrest.
U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds took in $265 billion this year through May 13, including $51 billion over the 30 days leading up to that date, the report said.
Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA, said the fact that growth-oriented equity ETFs represented 55% of the inflows during a period that included April’s market pullback shows that “investors are not in a risk-off mindset.”
“The ETF flow data and our fundamental outlook, told us we were still bullish on the market,” said Ullal, a member of the etf.com editorial advisory board.
ETF Investors Stay the Course
The S&P 500, as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), has gained 12% so far this year, including a slump last month sparked by fears over the stubbornness of inflation and the Fed’s inability to address it.
Over the 30-day period through May 13, defensive-oriented ETFs stood out, with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) gaining more than 11% and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) gaining nearly 6%, CFRA said.
“We found a lot of active funds with exposure to utilities and consumer staples that were among the best performers in April,” Ullal said.
Other sectors that held up during the pullback included financials, healthcare and materials.
“Factor and thematic ETFs that had tilts towards these sectors outperformed the broader markets in recent weeks,” Ullal said.
Looking beyond just the volatility of April, the report highlights the strength this year of shipping and cargo themed ETFs, which represent a proxy for international markets at a time when at least two wars are in the headlines.
The SonicShares Global Shipping ETF (BOAT) is up 24% this year and the U.S. Global Sea to Sky Cargo ETF (SEA) is up 18% this year.
Meanwhile, ETFs offering exposure to the U.S. transportation sector are lagging. The iShares U.S. Transportation ETF (IYT) is up 1.5% this year and the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN) is down 4.2%.
“There is more optimism around global growth this year,” Ullal said, citing projections for global merchandise volume to grow by nearly 3% this year, compared to a more than 1% decline last year.
“That’s another fundamental factor that has us bullish,” he said.
In terms of investors seemingly shrugging off the noisy geopolitical issues, Ullal said investors are sticking to the basics.

XLP,2024-05-16,Walmart ETFs Gain As Retail Giant's Earnings Jump,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-etfs-gain-retail-giants-213621891.html,"Shares of Walmart Inc. popped more than 6% to a record high on Thursday, pushing retail ETFs higher, after the world's largest company by revenue reported first quarter profit and sales that topped analyst estimates.
Earnings per share of 60 cents beat the 52 cents consensus estimate, according to MarketWatch. Revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $161.5 billion, ahead of the $159.5 billion expected.
The gain was Walmart's biggest since Nov. 15, 2022, when it rose by 6.5%. Costco, another giant retailer focused on value-conscious consumers, jumped 2% on the day to a record high of its own.
Walmart is a widely-owned stock within U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds. It's held in 294 ETFs, including dozens with substantial exposure to the stock, according to the etf.com stock finder.
Walmart is classified as a consumer staples stock, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard. With a $512 billion market cap, the stock is typically one of the three largest holdings within consumer staples ETFs.
For instance, the $15.6 billion Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) has Walmart as its third-largest position, with a nearly 10% weighting. Shares of Procter & Gamble and Costco make up 15% and 13% of the ETF, respectively. XLP was last trading up by 1.5% on the day. The ETF is up 9% year-to-date thanks to a 21% gain in Walmart over that same period.
WMT Earnings
The Bentonville, Arkansas company said that earnings and revenues for the full-year would be at or slightly higher than the upper end of its previous guidance, which called for net sales growth of 3% to 4% and operating income growth of 4% to 6%.
Walmart said that growth in its e-commerce business was particularly strong at 22%. Its advertising business, Walmart Connect, also saw strong growth of 26% during the quarter.

XLP,2024-05-13,Consumer Staples ETF (XLP) Hits New 52-Week High,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-staples-etf-xlp-hits-135600214.html,"For investors seeking momentum, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund XLP is probably on the radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up 19% from its 52-week low price of $65.18/share.

But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed:
XLP in Focus
Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund offers exposure to companies primarily involved in the development and production of consumer products that cover food and drug retailing, beverages, food products, tobacco, household products and personal products. The product charges 9 bps in annual fees (see: all the Consumer Staples ETFs here).
Why the Move?
The consumer staples segment of the broad stock market has been an area to watch lately, as investors are flocking into defensive sectors in search of cheap stocks. The consumer staples space is home to a variety of items like food & beverages, non-durable household goods, hypermarkets and consumer supercenters that are essential for daily needs. These products see steady demand even during an economic downturn due to their low level of correlation with economic cycles.
More Gains Ahead?
Currently, XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook. Therefore, it is hard to get a handle on its future returns one way or the other. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank. So, there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.

XLP,2024-05-10,Why Are Defensive Sectors Outperforming SPY?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-defensive-sectors-outperforming-spy-120000989.html,"The S&P 500 index, as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), has underperformed traditional defensive sectors—utilities and consumer staples—over the past month.
SPY’s one-month return is –0.3% while the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) gained 7% and 3%, respectively.
What does this say about investor sentiment? Is the economy beginning to soften?
Technology, Consumer Discretionary Sectors Lag
Leading sectors in 2023—technology and consumer discretionary—are also beginning to stumble as they logged one-month declines of –0.4% and –1.5%, respectively, as measured by the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY).
The tech and consumer discretionary (also known as consumer cyclicals) sectors combine to make up 40% of the S&P 500 index. Furthermore, the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks, which have contributed more to the market’s returns than any other single group, come from these two sectors.
Thus, the performance of the S&P 500 largely depends on the performance of the Mag 7 and the broader tech and consumer discretionary sectors.
Why Are Defensive Sectors Outperforming SPY?
Over the past month, prices for utilities and consumer staples stocks have gained while technology and consumer discretionary stocks have dropped. This may signal that investors are rotating sectors or cutting exposure to risk areas while to defensive areas.
Investors have had time to digest first quarter corporate earnings, which have been mostly positive according to Factset data. Still, sky-high expectations for Mag 7 stocks like Tesla Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. aren’t not being met, as reflected in their respective one-month returns of 1% and 1.5%.
This week, other consumer discretionary companies like Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb Inc. and Shopify, Inc. had positive earnings but provided weaker-than-expected forward guidance, disappointing investors and potentially indicating a softening in the economy.
The recent shift in investor sentiment may be short-lived, but it’s possible that investors are beginning to anticipate a prolonged economic slowdown in the second half of 2024, which would favor defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples over cyclical sectors like tech and consumer discretionary.

XLP,2024-05-10,These ETF Sectors Won Earnings Season,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etf-sectors-won-earnings-season-120000549.html,"Investing isn’t a contest, or at least it shouldn’t be. However, earnings season has become so much more volatile and unpredictable in terms of how the actual quarterly announcements from companies relate to how their stock prices react.
So as part of an advisor or investor’s ongoing market monitoring, it is worth taking a glance each quarter at how the 11 S&P 500 sectors do relative to each other.
While earnings announcements occur nearly every trading day, when mega-bank JP Morgan posts its results, the starter’s gun for the earnings track meet is generally thought to begin.
That last occurred on April 12, and so I reviewed returns of each sector “spider” ETF from that date through Tuesday’s close. Utilities were the winner, up 8.3%, as indicated by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU).
Those four words strung together as such (“utilities were the winner”) might be new to some investors, since it has been a long time since that small but high-yielding sector of the U.S. stock market led during an earnings season in which the stock market didn’t collapse.
The SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) gained 1.2% during this time frame, and the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) advanced 1.6%, so it was not a bad earnings period from that standpoint.
Low Energy Earnings for This ETF
The energy sector, as represented by the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE), was the laggard, down 3%. That reflects at least a modestly positive reception for corporate earnings this quarter. In all, nine of the 11 sectors were positive, though many by slim margins above zero return.
This naturally disguises the massive range of individual stock reactions to earnings, whether it was 10-20% higher between one night’s close and the next morning’s opening, or the same percentage change with a minus sign preceding it. That’s what earnings season has become: Five-week periods, where advisors and investors who own individual stocks have to put crash helmets on at 4 p.m. (ET), Monday-Thursday.
But that is why ETFs are so valuable in any investor’s tool set. They provide diversification, but we can also identify specific holdings each day (unlike with mutual funds), so we know what we own and can assess where the opportunities and risks are.
Consumer staples gained 4.6%, finishing second in the sector derby this time around. That performance by the Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF (XLP), combined with the sharp gains by XLU, recall some murky market periods, where such defense sectors outperformed.
However, it is just a month’s time, and besides, it is earnings season we are talking about. Watch, analyze, but don’t over-emphasize it.

XLP,2024-05-09,Recession-proof stocks are leading the market's latest leg higher,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recession-proof-stocks-are-leading-the-markets-latest-leg-higher-135138102.html,"Stocks have rebounded from a rough April, led by two sectors that typically outperform when the economy is in a downturn.
Since April 16, around when the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hit its recent bottom, Utilities (XLU) have led the charge, rising nearly 12%, accounting for all of the sector's gains year to date. Consumer Staples (XLP) stocks have risen almost 5% in that same period, while the S&P 500 is up about 2.7%.
Wall Street strategists said the two sectors are likely catching up after a dismal performance to start 2024.
Considering both sectors had been among the worst performers in the S&P 500 over the last year, Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner reasoned there's an aspect of the move that is merely investors rotating into an area that has yet to participate much in the recent market rally.
The Utilities sector entered March trading at its largest discount to the S&P 500 from a valuation standpoint (using a forward price-to-earnings ratio) since 2009, per Lerner. Meanwhile, Consumer Staples had underperformed the S&P 500 by almost 30% over the last year. This presented a potential buying opportunity in both traditionally ""defensive"" sectors.
""With markets up so much as we're up since October, people get nervous,"" Lerner told Yahoo Finance. ""They want to rotate into something a little more defensive, take some profit taking ... It's also just saying, 'Hey, what hasn't worked and what could have an opportunity to do some catching up or hold up better should the market correct?'""
There have been clear fundamental drivers of why Utilities would catch a bid over the past month. Earnings for the sector are up 26.7% this quarter compared to the same period last year. That's the second-highest growth rate of any sector, per FactSet. And there's growing conversation around how increased interest in projects involving artificial intelligence and electric vehicles could boost electricity demand for companies within the Utilities sector.
There have also been several macro catalysts at play. The move higher in Utilities, an interest rate-sensitive sector, has come as investors have digested the Fed's message last week that another rate hike is unlikely. This has sent the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down about 20 basis points from its 2024 high, providing a reprieve for a sector that has typically fallen as yields rise over the past year.
Another key movement has come in economic data. After economic growth continued to surprise Wall Street to start the year, data took a turn in April, highlighted by a weaker-than-expected jobs report and contraction in manufacturing activity for the month.

But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

XLRE,2024-09-23,Home prices need to fall 15% to ease market: Meredith Whitney,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/home-prices-fall-15-loosen-214809387.html,"As mortgage rates continue to fall, Meredith Whitney Advisory Group CEO Meredith Whitney joins Market Domination Overtime to break down the overall state of the housing market (XLRE).
""I don't think rates are low enough to really get the market moving. I think rates need to come down by another 100 basis points to really spark interest. And then there's a two-step process which prices have to come down, by our estimates, at least 15%, to make housing, even the carrying cost of a mortgage tolerable,"" Whitney tells Yahoo Finance.
She notes that the carrying cost of a mortgage has doubled to 40% over the last four years, which is why many buyers have continued to sit on the sidelines. While easing rates will make it more affordable for buyers to enter the market, she believes the larger issue remains in housing prices, which can only be solved by adding more inventory. Once that part of the equation is addressed, the market will finally see some relief.
Whitney also highlights the ""silver tsunami"" effect, where the aging population begins to downsize their homes. She explains that more than 60% of homes are owned by people over the age of 50. ""So there's a big issue, in terms of all the housing stock is owned by old people, and so it's harder for young people to get in. But, it's gotten increasingly expensive for these older people to stay in their homes because property taxes have gone up dramatically, as has homeowners insurance,"" she says, pointing to the ""real strain"" in the system.

Gidwaney believes that now is a good time for homeowners to consider getting a lower mortgage rate.
""If rates go down below 6%, about 4.7 million customers would become in the money for a refinance opportunity. And that's a significant amount of customers who may have bought a home in the last 2 or 3 years and are sitting on that higher rate... and could take advantage of a lower payment,"" she explains.
The lock-in effect has put pressure on the housing market as owners with low mortgage rates are holding off on listing their homes. However, as interest rates and mortgage rates come down, Gidwaney believes the lock-in effect could break up.
She tells Yahoo Finance that prospective homebuyers ""will start to be willing to purchase a home and be willing to take on a higher rate. And people have to move. They have to sell their home and they have to do other things in their life. So I think it's a great time for customers to start to do that.""

As the Fed's rate-cutting cycle is largely already priced into mortgage rates, she advises consumers not to try to time the market when looking to buy a home. Instead, she encourages them to speak with mortgage professionals to ensure they receive the best possible rate.
Home prices hit a record high in June, and with many choosing to stay in their homes for longer, Gidwaney believes that homeowners should leverage their increased equity:
""With mortgage rates the lowest that they've been basically all year, it is a very good time for customers to consider taking that equity and getting a cash-out [refinance], consolidating some of their higher-interest debt, like their credit card or auto loan debt, reducing their overall credit profile. It is a very good time, also, for customers to think about getting a HELOC [home equity line of credit] and using that home equity to their advantage.""

Compass Real Estate brokers Tom Postilio and Mickey Conlon join Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to discuss what the rate cut means for the US real estate market.
Postilio tells Yahoo Finance the real estate industry is “popping the champagne bottle, because for the last three years it's just been a lot of headwinds,” but the “half a point is big news.”
“August is typically a very sleepy month, [but this year] it was on fire,” Conlon says, explaining that typically there’s less interest in buying a home during the fall season, especially ahead of a presidential election.
“We hit the ground running, and that's all in anticipation of today's announcement,” as it seems people have put aside any election worries aside “because there's so much pent-up demand and there has been for three years” and “this announcement gave [buyers] permission to get off the fence,"" Conlon states.

The Fed's rate narrative ""does translate into almost a one-for-one cut in those construction loans that our members use in order to buy and improve land and start projects. So that's really what the Fed means for homebuilding in the short term,"" Tobin explains.
He touches on the latest economic proposals hinted at by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and why the focus should remain on the supply side of the housing market.

The chart of the day
What we're watching
What we're reading
Economic data releases and earnings
For the better part of 18 months, the stock market rally has been defined by the rise of artificial intelligence and its impact on a few large tech stocks.
But an increasing number of Wall Street strategists don't believe that thesis is what will drive the S&P 500's (^GSPC) next leg higher.
""Our sense is that NVDA is becoming just another Large Cap Growth stock,"" Citi's equity strategy team, led by Scott Chronert, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.
Nvidia's (NVDA) recent earnings release did little to impress investors. The stock fell about 6% the day after its earnings release. But that sour sentiment didn't permeate through the market as the S&P 500 closed flat on that same day. This marked the second straight quarter that the broader S&P 500 didn't move with Nvidia following its earnings release.
And, as Chronert's team highlights, after a more than 2,000% gain in the past five years, including gaining more than 110% this year alone, Nvidia stock appears to be coming back down to earth.
With that cooling off, the current moment may come to mark the end of the first AI-based chapter in this bull market.
""A simple look at the deceleration in rate of forward guidance increases suggests that [Nvidia's] most profound performance and fundamental impacts on index price action may be behind,"" Chronert's team wrote.
As top holding in the index, what Nvidia does on any given day will remain in focus as it can hold back or bolster the broader market's returns. But recent market action has shown a clear shift in what's driving investors to buy stocks. Instead of wondering how many generative AI chips one company is selling to a few others, developments in the macroeconomy are back to being top of mind for investors, especially the severity of the labor market's cooling.
Take what's driving the market. Since the start of the quarter on July 1, the S&P 500 is nearly flat. Nvidia, down nearly 15%, and the Magnificent Seven as a whole, off more than 5%, have both lagged the benchmark index.
Meanwhile, non-tech areas like Utilities, up about 12%, and Financials, up nearly 10%, have been leading the market rally, benefitting from investors positioning for interest rate cuts.
For now, it's a macro-driven market and every economic data release seems to matter more than an Nvidia earnings release or a headline about AI chip shipment delays.

NorthEnd Private Wealth CIO Alex McGrath joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the state of the market ahead of the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut.
""We're coming off the back end of a pretty long inflation battle here with rates being at historic peaks. And, you know, you look at the underlying macro data that we're staring at every day, and it's not exceptional, but it's not bad either. It's just kind of in this middling phase. And certainly a much better start to this week than we had last week,"" McGrath explains.
He argues that the Fed's cuts will not immediately come to the rescue as its cuts will likely ""take time to work through."" He adds, ""I don't think you have to look much further than a lot of the numbers we've seen from the consumer discretionary companies, where they're slashing forecast because the demand just isn't there like it has been. And that's not entirely surprising.""

While inflation is down, he argues, ""the problem is there's 20 to 30% built up in there that's still increasing on a month-over-month basis. And it's just the consumer's got to get tapped out at some point. And I'm not saying that's like a death and destruction phase coming, but you are starting to see inklings of that."" However, easing rates should help counter that issue.
Moving forward, McGrath believes the equities market ""could be a bit rocky,"" so investors should take more of a defensive approach and take a position in sectors like industrials (XLI), utilities (XLU), healthcare (XLV), real estate (XLRE), and consumer staples (XLP). He also recommends semiconductors, calling them ""the new industrial."" On the fixed-income side, he argues that ""it's probably time to start taking some duration there"" as the Fed kicks off its rate easing cycle.

SoFi head of investment strategy Liz Young Thomas joins Morning Brief to discuss the market's reaction to the data and how investors can best position their portfolios as the Federal Reserve begins its rate-easing cycle.
Thomas notes that ""equities are still cheering for the beginning of this rate-cutting cycle"" as the Fed eyes a soft landing. She explains that easing rates will likely benefit cyclical areas of the market, like small caps (^RUT), financials (XLF), real estate (XLRE), and industrials (XLI). However, she warns that ""it would be premature to assume that we have secured a soft landing.""
Investors should still have some exposure to areas of the market that benefit from a steepening yield curve. Thomas points to gold (GC=F) as a good option as the global currency is experiencing volatility.

XLRE,2024-08-26,Retail real estate: Finding opportunities in retail spaces,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/retail-real-estate-finding-opportunities-212828758.html,"With the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting current interest rates becoming more real, new opportunities could begin to arise for commercial retail estate in an easing rate environment.
Hines Global CIO David Steinbach joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into why now may be the time for investors to get into retail real estate.
""When you look on the private side of where to invest right now, again, we think the market is well poised for a recovery. A lot of capital is focused on a lot of other sectors... so there's a dearth of capital for deals. It is going to be mostly grocery-anchored, open-air spaces that activate, they're experience-based,"" Steinbach tells Yahoo Finance. ""Also spaces that have taken advantage of the omnichannel presence that a lot of online retailers have really used and still look at Whole Foods-Amazon (AMZN), that dynamic has driven footfall.""
Steinbach suggests avoiding investing in projects requiring ""massive renovation,"" such as closing mall spaces.

XLRE,2024-08-23,How lower rates would affect new vs. existing home sales,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/lower-rates-affect-vs-existing-223000686.html,"Housing stocks are rising following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, which signaled interest rate cuts to come that could feed into mortgage rates. This comes alongside surprisingly strong new home sales data for the month of July.
With the US housing market in need of relief, HousingWire lead analyst Logan Mohtashami joins Market Domination to discuss the potential impact of a rate cut on the housing market.
Mohtashami distinguishes between two segments of the housing market: new homes from builders and existing homes sales. He explains that when rates fall, homebuilders can ""sell homes like a commodity,"" while existing homes ""do not have that ability."" Existing homes are struggling to sell because the market hasn't seen mortgage rates under 6% for quite some time, Mohtashami explains.
""I think the builders will always have a rate advantage until mortgage rates get well below 6% for the existing home market,"" Mohtashami tells Yahoo Finance. ""If mortgage rates fell 2% and actually stayed lower below 6%, the existing home sales market could get some traction.""

YMAX,2024-07-24,YieldMax™ Launches Short NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (DIPS),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yieldmax-launches-short-nvda-option-105500822.html,"YieldMax
CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, July 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of the following ETF:
YieldMax™ Short NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: DIPS)
DIPS Overview
DIPS is an actively managed ETF that seeks to generate current income from a synthetic covered put strategy on NVIDIA Corporation (“NVDA”), while providing indirect short (inverse) exposure to the share price of NVDA. DIPS’s potential for gains from decreases in the share price of NVDA is limited, while its potential for losses resulting from increases in the share price of NVDA is up to 100%. DIPS does not invest directly in NVDA and does not directly short NVDA. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of NVDA should consider an investment other than this Fund.
DIPS Portfolio Construction
DIPS’s synthetic covered put strategy consists of the following four elements:
Synthetic short exposure to NVDA, consisting of a long at-the-money put option and a short at-the-money call option, which allows DIPS to seek to participate on an inverse, unleveraged basis in changes, up or down, to the share price of NVDA;
Covered put writing (where NVDA put options are sold against the synthetic short portion of the strategy), which allows DIPS to generate income;
U.S. Treasuries, which are used for collateral for the options, and which also generate income; and
Out-of-the money (“OTM”) call options, which are purchased to seek to cap DIPS’s potential losses from its short exposure to NVDA if NVDA’s share price appreciates significantly in value.
The loss capping works only if the NVDA share price rises to or above the strike price of the purchased OTM call options. If the NVDA share price increases but stays below the strike price of these options, DIPS will incur losses proportionate to this price increase, which may be up to 100% of your investment.
Why Invest in DIPS?
DIPS seeks to generate current income, which is not dependent on the price depreciation of NVDA.
DIPS seeks to benefit when the NVDA share price decreases, however DIPS’s potential corresponding benefit from decreases in the NVDA share price is limited.
DIPS’s short exposure to NVDA is not leveraged so does not result in daily resetting.
DIPS is the newest member of the growing YieldMax™ ETF family and, like all YieldMax™ ETFs, aims to deliver current income to investors. Please see table below for distribution and yield information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs. Note: DIPS, FIAT and CRSH are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”.
Please note that distributions may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time, and may have additional tax implications.

Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time.
The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717.
Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant.
1 YMAX and YMAG each have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. ULTY has a gross expense ratio of 1.24%, but the investment adviser has agreed to a 0.10% fee waiver through at least February 28, 2025.
2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on July 15, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying an ETF’s Distribution per Share by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.
3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended June 30, 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. As of such date, the ULTY subsidized and unsubsidized 30-Day SEC Yields were 0.00% and 0.00%, respectively. The subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect while the unsubsidized yield does not adjust for any fee waivers in effect.
Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount.

Risk Information
Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest.
Risk Disclosures (the following risks are applicable to all YieldMax ETFs shown in the table above)
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.
Underlying Security Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF invests in options contracts that are based on the value of its Underlying Security. This subjects each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of its Underlying Security, even though it does not. As a result, each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF is subject to the risks associated with the industry of the corresponding Underlying Issuer.
Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. The Underlying YieldMax™ ETFs investment strategies are options-based. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international policies, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.
Distribution Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF aims to provide monthly income, although there's no guarantee of distribution in any given month, and the distribution amounts may vary significantly. Monthly distributions may consist of capital returns, reducing each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF's NAV and trading price over time, thus potentially leading to significant losses for investors (including the Fund), especially as an Underlying YieldMax™ ETF's returns exclude any dividends paid by the Underlying Security, which may result in lesser income compared to a direct investment in the Underlying Security.
NAV Erosion Risk Due to Distributions. When an Underlying YieldMax™ ETF makes a distribution, its NAV typically drops by the distribution amount on the related ex-dividend date. The repetitive payment of distributions may significantly erode an Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s NAV and trading price over time, potentially resulting in notable losses for investors (including the Fund).
Call Writing Strategy Risk. The continuous application of each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF's call writing strategy impacts its ability to participate in the positive price returns of its Underlying Security, which in turn affects each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s returns both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time frames. An Underlying YieldMax™ ETF's participation in its Underlying Security's positive price returns and its own returns will depend not only on the Underlying Security's price but also on the path the Underlying Security's price takes over time, illustrating that certain price trajectories of the Underlying Security could lead to suboptimal outcomes for the Underlying YieldMax™ ETF.
Single Issuer Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF, focusing on an individual security (Underlying Security), may experience more volatility compared to traditional pooled investments or the market generally due to issuer-specific attributes. Its performance may deviate from that of diversified investments or the overall market, making it potentially more susceptible to the specific performance and risks associated with the Underlying Security.
High Portfolio Turnover Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s expenses.
Counterparty Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF faces counterparty risk through its investments in options contracts, held via clearing members due to its non-membership in clearing houses, with the risk exacerbated if a clearing member defaults or if limited clearing members are willing to transact on its behalf. This risk is also magnified as the Underlying YieldMax™ ETF primarily focuses on options contracts on a single security, potentially leading to losses or hindrance in implementing its investment strategy if adverse situations with clearing members arise.
Price Participation Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF employs a strategy of selling call option contracts, limiting its participation in the value increase of the Underlying Security during the call period. Should an Underlying Security’s value increase beyond the sold call options' strike price, the Underlying YieldMax™ ETF may not experience the same extent of increase, potentially underperforming the Underlying Security and experiencing a NAV decrease, especially given its full exposure to any value decrease of the Underlying Security over the call period.
New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.
Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. As a result, a decline in the value of an investment in a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers could cause the Fund’s overall value to decline to a greater degree than if the Fund held a more diversified portfolio.
YieldMax™ ETFs are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC. Foreside is not affiliated with Tidal Financial Group, YieldMax™ ETFs or ZEGA Financial.

CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, July 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of the following ETF:
YieldMax™ Short COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: FIAT)
FIAT Overview
FIAT is an actively managed ETF that seeks to generate current income from a synthetic covered put strategy on Coinbase Global, Inc. (“COIN”), while providing indirect short (inverse) exposure to the share price of COIN. FIAT’s potential for gains from decreases in the share price of COIN is limited, while its potential for losses resulting from increases in the share price of COIN is up to 100%.

1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX, YMAG and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. ULTY has a gross expense ratio of 1.24% but the investment adviser has agreed to a 0.10% fee waiver through at least February 28, 2025.
2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on June 24, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying such distribution by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.
3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended May 31, 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. As of May 31, 2024, the ULTY subsidized and unsubsidized 30-Day SEC Yields were 0.00% and 0.00%, respectively. The subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect while the unsubsidized yield does not adjust for any fee waivers in effect.
4 Each ETF’s strategy (except CRSH’s) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. CRSH’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares decrease in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares increase in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.

Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s).
The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717.
Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant.

Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except CRSH)
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.
Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference assets.
Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY)
Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies.
There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment.
Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT)
YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT.
Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered.
Risk Disclosures (applicable only to CRSH)
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. TSLA Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the share price of TSLA common stock (TSLA). This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted shares of TSLA, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the share price of TSLA, the Fund is subject to the risk that TSLA’s share price increases. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the price decreases of TSLA and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if TSLA shares increase in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to TSLA if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the share price of TSLA increases to a price that is at or above the strike price of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the share price of TSLA to a price that is below the strike price of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike price that is approximately 100% above the then-current share price of TSLA at the time of the call option purchase, and the share price of TSLA increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (""cleared derivatives""). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by TSLA over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.

1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX, YMAG and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs.

2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on May 20, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying such distribution by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.
3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended April 30, 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.
4 Each ETF’s strategy (except CRSH’s) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. CRSH’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares decrease in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares increase in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.

Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except CRSH)
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.
Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference assets.
Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY)
Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies.
There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment.
Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT)
YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT.
Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered.
Risk Disclosures (applicable only to CRSH)
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. TSLA Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the share price of TSLA common stock (TSLA). This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted shares of TSLA, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the share price of TSLA, the Fund is subject to the risk that TSLA’s share price increases. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the price decreases of TSLA and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if TSLA shares increase in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to TSLA if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the share price of TSLA increases to a price that is at or above the strike price of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the share price of TSLA to a price that is below the strike price of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike price that is approximately 100% above the then-current share price of TSLA at the time of the call option purchase, and the share price of TSLA increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (""cleared derivatives""). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by TSLA over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.

As of May 20, 2024, the YieldMax™ Gold Miners Option Income Strategy ETF did not hold any shares of the VanEck® Gold Miners ETF (GDX®). The holdings of GDX® in such fund were 0.00% as of such date.

YMAX,2024-04-23,YieldMax™ Launches Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF YBIT,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yieldmax-launches-bitcoin-option-income-105500782.html,"YieldMax
CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, April 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of the YieldMax™ Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: YBIT).
YBIT seeks to generate current income via a synthetic covered call strategy on one or more select U.S.-listed exchange-traded products that seek exposure to Bitcoin (each a “Bitcoin ETP”). YBIT is actively managed by ZEGA Financial.
When selecting Bitcoin ETPs on which to trade options, ZEGA focuses primarily on the following two key factors:
Preference for Bitcoin ETPs that hold ""physical"" or ""spot"" Bitcoin over such ETPs that reference Bitcoin indirectly via futures contracts.
Selection of Bitcoin ETPs that have sufficient option liquidity to support YBIT’s trading activities.
YBIT does not invest directly in any Bitcoin ETP. YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the YBIT.
YBIT is the newest member of the growing YieldMax™ ETF family and, like all YieldMax™ ETFs, aims to deliver current income to investors. Please see table below for distribution and yield information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs.

1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX, YMAG and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. ULTY has a gross expense ratio of 1.24%, but the investment adviser has agreed to a 0.10% fee waiver through at least February 28, 2025.
2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on April 22, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying such distribution by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.
3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended March 31, 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.
4 Each ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.
Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund’s objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount.

Risk Disclosures (Unless stated otherwise, the noted risks below apply to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above)
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.
Applicable only to YBIT: Bitcoin ETP Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered.
Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current monthly income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.
Investors in the Fund will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions, if any, with respect to the Fund’s underlying reference asset.
Holdings
As of April 22, 2024, the YieldMax™ Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF: (i) does not hold a position in any Bitcoin ETP (ii) does not hold a position in Bitcoin or any other digital assets; (iii) does not hold derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets; and (iv) does not hold or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Any such holdings in such fund were 0.00% as of such date.

YMAX,2024-02-29,YieldMax™ Launches the Ultra Option Income Strategy ETF ULTY,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yieldmax-launches-ultra-option-income-135400731.html,"YieldMax
CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of the YieldMax™ Ultra Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: ULTY).
ULTY Overview
ULTY is an actively managed ETF that seeks to generate monthly income from a portfolio of covered call strategies, each on a U.S. listed security (the “Underlying Security/ies”). ULTY also provides direct or indirect exposure to the share price returns of the Underlying Securities, subject to a limit on potential investment gains for each such security.
ULTY Portfolio Construction
ULTY’s investment sub-adviser, ZEGA Financial LLC, will typically select between 15 and 30 Underlying Securities, primarily on the basis of such securities’ implied volatility levels. Higher implied volatility usually correlates with increased options premiums, aligning with ULTY’s aim of generating monthly income from its portfolio of covered call strategies.
ZEGA will regularly review ULTY’s portfolio to determine whether one or more of its covered call strategies should be increased, decreased or eliminated, and whether any such strategy should be implemented on any new Underlying Securities.
Why Invest in ULTY?
ULTY seeks to generate current monthly income from a portfolio of covered call strategies, each on an Underlying Security.
ULTY seeks to participate in a portion of the gains, if any, experienced by each Underlying Security.
ULTY is the newest member of the YieldMax™ ETF family and, like all YieldMax™ ETFs, aims to deliver monthly income to investors. Please see table below for distribution and yield information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs.

Risk Information
Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest.
Risk Disclosures
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. THE FUND, TRUST, ADVISER, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING ISSUER. Underlying Security Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF invests in options contracts that are based on the value of its Underlying Security. This subjects each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of its Underlying Security, even though it does not. As a result, each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF is subject to the risks associated with the industry of the corresponding Underlying Issuer. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. The Underlying YieldMax™ ETFs investment strategies are options-based. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international policies, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF aims to provide monthly income, although there's no guarantee of distribution in any given month, and the distribution amounts may vary significantly. Monthly distributions may consist of capital returns, reducing each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF's NAV and trading price over time, thus potentially leading to significant losses for investors (including the Fund), especially as an Underlying YieldMax™ ETF's returns exclude any dividends paid by the Underlying Security, which may result in lesser income compared to a direct investment in the Underlying Security. NAV Erosion Risk Due to Distributions. When an Underlying YieldMax™ ETF makes a distribution, its NAV typically drops by the distribution amount on the related ex-dividend date. The repetitive payment of distributions may significantly erode an Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s NAV and trading price over time, potentially resulting in notable losses for investors (including the Fund). Call Writing Strategy Risk. The continuous application of each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF's call writing strategy impacts its ability to participate in the positive price returns of its Underlying Security, which in turn affects each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s returns both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time frames. An Underlying YieldMax™ ETF's participation in its Underlying Security's positive price returns and its own returns will depend not only on the Underlying Security's price but also on the path the Underlying Security's price takes over time, illustrating that certain price trajectories of the Underlying Security could lead to suboptimal outcomes for the Underlying YieldMax™ ETF. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. Single Issuer Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF, focusing on an individual security (Underlying Security), may experience more volatility compared to traditional pooled investments or the market generally due to issuer-specific attributes. Its performance may deviate from that of diversified investments or the overall market, making it potentially more susceptible to the specific performance and risks associated with the Underlying Security. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. Each Underlying YieldMax™ ETF may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Underlying YieldMax™ ETF’s expenses. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.
YieldMax™ ETFs are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC. Foreside is not affiliated with Tidal Financial Group, YieldMax™ ETFs or ZEGA Financial.

1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX and YMAG) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs.
2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on February 21, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying such distribution by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.
3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended January 31, 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.
4 Each ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.

About ZEGA Financial
Founded in 2011, ZEGA Financial is a SEC-registered investment adviser and investment manager that specializes in derivatives. The firm leverages technology, data, experience, and proprietary strategies to craft products and services for advisors and individual investors. ZEGA Financial helps investors successfully navigate volatile and uncertain markets through innovative hedging strategies. The firm’s founding principles grew out of the bestselling book co-authored by Jay Pestrichelli, ZEGA’s CEO and Co-Founder, entitled “Buy and Hedge, the Five Iron Rules for Investing Over the Long Term.” His book highlights how to bridge the complicated nature of options investing with the needs of the everyday investor.
Risk Disclosures
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. MSTR Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of MSTR. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of MSTR, even though it does not. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund's call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of MSTR and, in turn, the Fund's returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (""cleared derivatives""). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current monthly income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by MSTR over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.
Investors in the Fund(s) will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying stock.
Holdings
As of February 21, 2024, the YieldMax™ MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF did not hold any shares of MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR). The holdings of MSTR in such fund were 0.00% as of such date.
YieldMax™ ETFs are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC. Foreside is not affiliated with Tidal Financial Group, YieldMax™ ETFs or ZEGA Financial.

AWAY,2024-01-29,Amplify ETFs Completes Acquisition to Reach $9.1 Billion AUM Across 31 ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amplify-etfs-completes-acquisition-reach-114500687.html,"Well-known ETFs complement Amplify’s existing lineup of income, core, and thematic ETFs
CHICAGO, Jan. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amplify ETFs announced today it has completed its previously announced acquisition of ETF Managers Group (ETFMG) exchange-traded fund (ETF) assets, which consist of over $3.7 billion of assets under management (AUM) across 14 ETFs (as of 1/26/2024). Amplify ETFs will now manage $9.1 billion of AUM as of 1/26/2024.
“The completion of Amplify’s first sizable ETF acquisition begins an exciting new chapter for our organization,” said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs. “Since 2016, Amplify has sought to develop innovative products that provide professionally crafted access to unique market segments and investment strategies. The addition of these ETFs is an extension of our existing product development mandate and allows Amplify to significantly grow its unique investor solution set.”
Magoon added, “We envision a brighter future for the acquired ETFs as they both complement our existing product lineup and will experience increased awareness and availability due to our current momentum across national accounts, distribution, and marketing. We look forward to engaging with investors on these timely market segments and themes.”
Amplify ETFs finished 2023 at a record high ETF AUM and shares outstanding. Amplify ETFs grew its AUM by 36% on the year, outpacing the overall US ETF industry’s growth rate of 26%. The completion of this acquisition positions Amplify in the top 13% of ETF sponsors.*
“While working through the transaction this past year, we remained committed to our overall mission of adding value to investor portfolios,” said William Belden, President of Amplify ETFs. “We launched three new ETFs in areas of the market that were untouched or open for enhancement.”
Effective as of the close of business on January 26, the following ETFMG ETFs have been reorganized into corresponding newly created exchange-traded funds of Amplify ETFs.

CWEB,2024-09-30,China ETFs Retrench After Historic Rally,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-etfs-retrench-historic-rally-202256491.html,"Chinese equities, which rallied to their best day in 16 years, started to test the limits of investor enthusiasm during U.S. trading hours on Monday.
The $4.7 billion iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) was roughly flat in midday trading, losing some of the ground it gained after the Chinese central bank announced a sweeping stimulus package last week. MCHI is up more than 18% over the past five trading days, accounting for most of its year-to-date gains.
Chinese equities rallied after the People's Bank of China said it would lower the benchmark interest rate and reduce the amount of money banks must allocate for reserves as it aims to boost lending and fix its sagging economy. It will also offer about $70 billion in loans to brokers, funds and other financial services organizations to purchase Chinese equities.
The $4.3 billion iShares Trust China Large Cap ETF (FXI), fell about 1% on Monday, although it is up nearly 15% over the last five trading days.
etf.com
Paul Schatz, president of Heritage Capital in Woodbridge, Conn., compared to the recent rally in Chinese stocks to what happened with U.S. equities in 2008, “but that may be just grasping for comps.”
“Chinese stocks were heavily shorted, and the initial move squeezed those investors like they haven’t seen in years,” he said. “Two days later, the squeeze came again and then again. These are the kinds of moves that just puts funds out of business if they short.”
Bearish China ETF YANG Gains
Meanwhile, there is a sign of life for an ETF that shorts Chinese equities. The $158 million Direxion Daily FTSE China Bear 3X Shares ETF (YANG), which is down more than 42% over the past five days and nearly 68% this year, climbed more than 3% in mid-day trading Monday.
“The move in the Chinese equity markets has definitely been significant with markets up over 20% since the announcement last week of stimulus measures,” said Stephen Kolano, chief investment officer at Integrated Partners in Waltham, Mass.
“While the near term reaction has been very positive, given the size and opaque nature of the Chinese property market, and the fact that much of it sits at the local authority level, it is still very unclear as to whether the stimulus announced will be enough to help kick-start the property market sustainably,” he added.
Chinese equity markets went through a similar ride in May following the last round of economic stimulus aimed at getting ahead of a deflationary threat.
“The move in Chinese risk assets is understandable given the raft of fiscal and monetary policy initiatives announced by Chinese authorities of late, including an interest rate cut, lower cash reserves for banks and loans to funds, brokers and insurers to buy Chinese stocks,” said Tim Holland, chief investment officer at Orion in Omaha, Neb.

DIA,2024-10-01,Investing.com Poll: What will be the outcome of Friday's US jobs report?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-com-poll-outcome-fridays-152532630.html,"Investing.com -- The latest US nonfarm payrolls report on Friday is due to highlight the economic calendar this week.
Economists expect the US economy to add 144,000 jobs in September, up slightly from 142,000 in the prior month. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, is seen matching August's level of 4.2%.
In August, payrolls rose from a heavily-downwardly revised reading of 89,000 and were below forecasts of 164,000, while the jobless rate ticked down from 4.3%. As a whole, the numbers indicated a downshift in labor demand -- a trend identified by several Federal Reserve officials as a key driving force behind their decision to announce a jumbo 50-basis point interest rate reduction last month.
Analysts at ING argued in a note to clients that the jobs market continues to hold ""the key to the pace"" of upcoming potential interest rate cuts, particularly as inflation -- once the major focus of a series of aggressive Fed borrowing cost hikes -- shows signs of abating.
""If we get the unemployment rate rising back to 4.3% next Friday and a sub 75,000 payrolls print expect the calls for a second 50 [basis point] rate cut to grow markedly,"" the ING analysts said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Monday that the central bank would likely opt for more traditional quarter-point interest rate cuts moving forward, but stressed that the future path of borrowing costs is not on a preset course.
Powell added that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is not ""in a hurry to cut rates quickly"" despite announcing the outsized drawdown at its Sept. 17-18 gathering. He defended the decision, saying it reflected the FOMC's ""growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2%.""
On Tuesday, US job openings unexpectedly increased slightly in August, potentially indicating some resilience in cooling labor demand in the third quarter.
The closely-monitored Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that available positions, a proxy for labor demand, rose to 8.040 million on the final business day of August, climbing from an upwardly-revised tally of 7.711 million in July. Economists had predicted the so-called JOLTS report would dip marginally to 7.640 million.
In July, the figure slipped to its lowest mark in three-and-a-half years, which was seen as a possible sign that the US jobs market was losing steam -- albeit in an orderly fashion.

DIA,2024-09-28,Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) Closes at Record High on Tame Inflation Data,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-jones-industrial-average-nyse-214848799.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) closed at an all-time high after new data showed that inflation in the U.S. continues to trend down towards the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
The leading index that is comprised of 30 blue-chip stocks and meant to act as a proxy for the U.S. economy finished trading on Sept. 27 up 137 points, or 0.3%, and at an all-time high of 42,313.00. It was the 32nd time this year that the Dow closed at a record high.
The latest all-time high was achieved after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, showed consumer prices continued to cool in August, declining to an annualized rate of 2.2%. That’s near the U.S. central bank’s 2% annualized inflation target. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.7% during August.
Markets Remain Buoyant
Markets have remained buoyant since the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 50-basis points on Sept. 18. While it closed down 0.18% on Sept. 27, the benchmark S&P 500 index has hit several record highs since the U.S. central bank cut rates and signaled further reductions are likely in coming months.
Elsewhere, China’s CSI 300 stock index rose 4.5% on Sept. 27, ending the week up 16% for its biggest weekly increase since 2008. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index recorded its biggest weekly gain since 1998. The increase in Chinese equities was driven by news of government stimulus measures for the domestic economy. Also, gold’s price continues to rise, with the precious metal on track for its largest quarterly gain on record.
Is the DIA ETF a Buy?
The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust, which is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the movements of the Dow 30 index, has a consensus Hold rating among 61 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 50 buy and 11 Hold recommendations made in the last three months. The average price target of $468.47 implies 10.76% upside from current levels.

DIA,2024-09-26,Advisors' Surging ETF Use Led by Active Funds: Fidelity,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advisors-surging-etf-led-active-180327808.html,"Financial advisors continue buying ETFs for their clients in increasing numbers, according to a recent Fidelity survey that found gains largely coming from purchases of more expensive actively managed funds as opposed to passive funds that generally track an index.
Purchases of active exchange-traded funds more than doubled among financial advisors since 2022, the Fidelity Institutional report on portfolio construction trends found. Based on over 3,000 professionally managed investment portfolios reviewed in the second quarter, the report states that 29% of advisors now have allocations to actively managed ETFs, up from 13% in 2022.
Among advisors using active ETFs, the average allocation is 17%, Fidelity’s analysis shows, with a particular focus on fixed income.
Active ETF Growth Driven by Fixed Income
Fidelity attributes the growing popularity of ETFs to advantages such as better tax efficiency, lower costs, and intraday liquidity compared to other investment vehicles. The report shows that 68% of incoming portfolios utilize both mutual funds and ETFs, while 74% of target portfolios include both vehicles.
Index funds remain the most popular product among advisors, especially for domestic equities, according to Fidelity's data.
The average portfolio reviewed contains 13 holdings from 6 different asset managers, with underlying blended fees of 50 basis points, the report notes.
Fidelity’s analysis reveals that 24% of portfolios with large-cap exposure utilize only passive products, which could lead to unintended concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks.
The report indicates that advisors have been reallocating from fixed income to equities to take on risk and participate in the market.
Fixed income allocations remained at 29%, the lowest in 2 years, according to Fidelity's data.
While investment grade allocations were at a two-year high last quarter, they have dropped to 80% in the second quarter, the report shows.
In the equity space, the report revealed that the average equity sleeve of a portfolio was 68% in the second quarter.
Seventy-nine percent of the equity sleeve is allocated to U.S. equities versus 21% in international, Fidelity’s analysis shows.
Within U.S. equity, the average portfolio has 66% allocated to large-cap, 22% to mid-caps and 12% to small caps, which is largely unchanged from previous quarters, according to the report.
Fidelity’s data indicates that advisors continued to increase their allocation to sensitive sectors—including communication services and technology—along with growth allocation.

DIA,2024-09-19,SEC Updates Rules for $55T Equity Markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-updates-rules-55t-equity-192427638.html,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved updates to rules governing the $55 trillion equity markets, SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced in a statement on Wednesday.
These changes are designed to “enhance competition, efficiency, and fairness, benefitting investors and capital formation alike,” Powell said.
The updates come nearly two decades after the last comprehensive review of national market system rules in 2005, the statement noted. The changes come as transaction volume in listed equities has doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17 years, data in the statement showed.
""There's been a significant increase in everyday investor participation in the markets,"" Gensler said in a statement, adding that 58% of American households own stocks.
Key changes include relaxing the one-penny minimum quotation increment to half a penny for many stocks.
This reduction in “tick size” will allow stocks to be priced more efficiently and competitively, potentially lowering costs for investors and improving liquidity, the SEC explained.
Lowering Exchanges' Maximum Fees
The new rules also lower the maximum fee that exchanges can charge for accessing the best bid or offer from three-tenths of a penny to one-tenth of a penny.
This change addresses concerns raised by market participants about price transparency, market complexity and potential conflicts of interest, Gensler’s statement said.
Additionally, the updated rules implement a new definition of a round lot, replacing the 120-year-old standard of 100 shares.
The new definition introduces a tiered system (100, 40, 10, or 1 share) based on share price, which could lead to better pricing for investors, according to the announcement.
The reforms also aim to provide greater transparency on quotes for orders smaller than a round lot, known as “odd lots,” the SEC disclosed.
The SEC chair highlighted that approximately 74% of share volume is currently being quoted at less than 1.5 pennies, up from 54% in 2005.
Gensler said that these reforms “will help promote greater transparency, competition, fairness, and efficiency in our $55 trillion equity markets.”

DIA,2024-09-18,Major ETFs Climb After Fed Slashes Interest Rate,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/major-etfs-climb-fed-slashes-182553876.html,"Major equity ETFs jumped after the U.S. central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by half of a percentage point, amid growing concerns that slowing growth had become a bigger worry than inflation.
The $554 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the world's largest exchange-traded fund, climbed 0.5% after the decision. The second and third largest funds, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which both have over $500 billion in AUM and track the S&P 500 index of major stocks, moved in sync with SPY. The tech-focused Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) rose 0.7%.
Each of the funds had traded flat-to-lower earlier in the day.
The Federal Reserve sliced the federal funds rate to 475-500 bps, which seemed unlikely just a week ago. But analysts trying to predict the Fed's next move swung heavily toward a larger cut after a mildly encouraging Consumer Price Index reading last week and as economic data has increasingly raised the prospect of a steep recession.
In a statement, the Federal Reserve said that it was confident that inflation was headed ""sustainably"" toward the bank's goal of an annual 2% increase, but that ""the economic outlook is uncertain.""
""The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate"" to keep inflation in check without undercutting the jobs market, the bank said. ""In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent,"" the bank said.
In a press conference after the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the ""recalibration"" of the bank's ""policy stance will help maintain strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation.""
He said that if the economy ""evolves as expected, the median participant [in the policy decision] projects that the appropriate level"" for interest rates will be ""4.4% at the end of this year and 3.4% at the end of 2025."" But he also noted that the bank was ""not on any preset course,"" and that it would ""continue to make...decisions meeting by meeting.""
The Fed last cut the rate in July 2020 to help stimulate an economy reeling from massive shutdowns tied to the Covid-19 pandemic.
As inflation soared to its highest levels in four decades, the central bank adopted a more hawkish stance, raising rates 11 times starting in July 2022 with the last increase 14 months ago.

DIA,2024-09-11,"State Street, Apollo Propose Private Credit ETF",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-apollo-propose-private-181436775.html,"State Street Global Advisors and Apollo Global Management are collaborating to introduce a private credit ETF that would offer retail investors access to private credit markets, according to a Tuesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
The proposed SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF would invest in a mix of public and private investment-grade debt securities, marking one of the first attempts to package private credit investments into an ETF wrapper, the filing said.
The proposed ETF comes as major asset managers seek ways to make private market investments more accessible to individual investors. Private credit has seen rapid growth in recent years but has largely been limited to institutional investors.
The State Street-Apollo product fund would invest at least 80% of its assets in investment-grade debt, including both public credit-related and private credit investments sourced by Apollo, according to the prospectus. Up to 20% could be allocated to high-yield bonds, the filing said.
Private Credit Innovation
A key feature of the proposed private credit ETF is Apollo’s promise to provide daily pricing for the private investments it sources, the filing said. This approach aims to make traditionally illiquid private credit more tradable, potentially attracting investors interested in this market.
The fund aims to provide income and maximize returns while managing risk by actively investing in U.S. investment-grade bonds, according to the prospectus. These may include government and corporate bonds, securitized loans, mortgage-backed securities, and other debt instruments.
The filing did not specify a proposed ticker symbol or expense ratio, and the new fund would still require regulatory approval before coming to market.
As of June 30, New York-based Apollo had approximately $696 billion of assets under management, according to company data. State Street is the world’s fourth-largest asset manager with $4.4 trillion in assets. Its ETF business manages 138 funds accounting for $1.3 trillion in assets.

DIA,2024-09-10,State Street Unveils Galaxy-Managed Digital Asset ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-unveils-galaxy-managed-202809948.html,"State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) has introduced three actively managed ETFs focused on digital assets and disruptive technologies, sub-advised by Galaxy Asset Management.
The new offerings will target companies involved in blockchain, cryptocurrency and other emerging technologies, according to a press release announcing the funds.
“Digital assets and blockchain technology have the power to transform financial markets as well as the economy over the next decade, and a number of companies will grow and flourish thanks to their contribution to this transformative technology,” said Anna Paglia, SSGA chief business officer, said in the release.
The ETFs debut as issuers try to address strong demand for crypto-focused investment products following the success of spot bitcoin ETFs, which have generated nearly $17 billion in inflows since they started trading in January.
The SPDR Galaxy Digital Asset Ecosystem ETF (DECO) focuses on companies benefiting from blockchain and digital asset adoption, including cryptocurrency exposures through ETFs and futures, according to Matt Bartolini, head of Americas research at SPDR.
“DECO is going to try to hold the whole entire ecosystem of companies that Galaxy deems to be on the leading edge of the digital asset ecosystem for some of that long-term capital appreciation,” Bartolini told etf.com in an interview.
The SPDR Galaxy Hedged Digital Asset Ecosystem ETF (HECO) offers similar exposure but incorporates an options overlay to manage volatility, Bartolini said.
Meanwhile, SPDR Galaxy Transformative Tech Accelerators ETF (TEKX) targets the “infrastructure, the backbone of what makes up those digital asset technologies,” Bartolini said.
Digital Asset Innovation
The partnership combines State Street’s ETF expertise with Galaxy’s digital asset knowledge, Bartolini said.
“Galaxy, they're a global leader in digital assets,” Bartolini said. ""They have a diversified business across different digital asset industries, whether it's within blockchain, offering institutional grade financial services, developing blockchain infrastructure, mining, you name it. I think they've been one of the leaders in the overall global digital economy.”
Bartolini cautioned that the nascent industry remains volatile and that ETFs will be concentrated in single stocks and specific industries, leading to idiosyncratic risks.
HECO aims to manage some of this volatility for clients seeking digital asset exposure with potentially less risk than DECO’s pure approach, Bartolini added.

DIA,2024-09-09,Lazard Taps State Street Veteran to Lead ETF Push,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lazard-taps-state-street-veteran-194152380.html,"Lazard Asset Management has appointed Robert Forsyth as its global head of ETFs, bolstering the firm's efforts to expand its presence in the rapidly growing active ETF space.
According to a press release from New York-based Lazard, Forsyth will join the firm as managing director and be responsible for growing Lazard’s active ETF business.
“Building and expanding an active ETF platform is a key next step in our plans and Rob will play an important role in accelerating our ambitions,” Evan Russo, Lazard Asset Management CEO, stated in the release.
The move comes as the ETF market is shifting toward actively managed products.
Despite active ETFs accounting for less than a tenth of total ETF assets under management in the U.S., they make up nearly half of all ETF offerings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This year has seen actively managed ETFs capture about one-third of the total inflows into U.S.-listed ETFs, indicating growing investor interest in this category.
Forsyth, who will be based in New York and report to Head of North American Distribution Jennifer Ryan, brings over two decades of experience in exchange-traded products to his new role, the release said. He most recently served as global head of ETF strategy at State Street Global Advisors, where he held various leadership positions in product, investment, and sales strategy for its $1 trillion ETF business.
Lazard's Entry Into ETF Market
Forsyth’s appointment follows Lazard’s recent entry into the ETF market. In June, the firm introduced its first ETF product, the Lazard Global Listed Infrastructure Active ETF (GIFL), for Australian investors. The company plans to build on this debut, along with a new sub-advised ETF mandate in the U.S.
As of July 31, Lazard’s asset management business managed approximately $246 billion in client assets, according to the firm.
“The Lazard brand, the quality of its investment products, and the firm’s global reach will help bring sophisticated investment products to a larger number of clients through exchange traded products,"" Forsyth said.

DIA,2024-09-06,State Street Debuts 3 ETFs With Targeted Strategies,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-debuts-3-etfs-205930315.html,"State Street Global Advisors, the asset management arm of State Street Corporation, has introduced three new ETFs designed to give investors a wider range of stock- and commodities-focused investment options while managing risk, according to a company press release.
The new offerings include the SPDR SSGA US Equity Premium Income ETF (SPIN), the SPDR S&P Emerging Markets ex-China ETF (XCNY), and the SPDR Bloomberg Enhanced Roll Yield Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (CERY).
SPIN has an expense ratio of 0.25%, XCNY charges 0.15%, and CERY comes with a 0.28% expense ratio, according to the press release.
New ETFs Target Specific Portfolio Needs
Matt Bartolini, head of Americas research at SPDR, said in an interview with etf.com that the new ETFs would address current market trends and investor needs.
“Let's just take SPIN first,” Bartolini said. “When we look at it, clients sort of have some central outcomes they're looking for when they build portfolios. The first, obviously, capital appreciation. The second is income. The third is managing risk.”
SPIN, an actively managed ETF, aims to enhance income generation through a dynamic call writing program while maintaining potential for long-term capital growth, Bartolini said.
“We're actually combining three different portfolio management teams into one ETF here,” Bartolini said. The fund integrates a fundamental equity team that builds the underlying portfolio, an investment solutions team that identifies market risk expectations, and a systematic equity team that implements the options overlay program.
This combination, according to Bartolini, allows SPIN to potentially generate income while maintaining upside potential.
XCNY seeks to track a market-capitalization-weighted index of emerging market companies, excluding those domiciled in China, Bartolini said.
“One of the reasons why you want to use emerging market equities in a portfolio is to be somewhat diversified globally, but then also seek out some potential for higher returns,” he said.
CERY aims to track the Bloomberg Enhanced Roll Yield Total Return Index, providing broad commodities market exposure with a focus on diversification and enhanced roll yields, according to Bartolini.
“The index that we're seeking to track, it's a very novel index in and of itself,” Bartolini said. They’re trying to be diversified across different aspects of the commodities market, ""looking at different futures curves where they’re more in backwardation than in contango,"" he added.
Bartolini also discussed potential risks for each ETF. For SPIN, he noted that a bull rally could limit upside potential due to the covered call strategy. CERY and XCNY are more sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, he explained.

The group said assets had fallen below a specific threshold of $50 million across its six remaining ETFs, which will stop trading on Sept. 17.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the closures.
Morgan Stanley ETFs Closing
MS SciBeta HFE US Equity 6F EW UCITS ETF (USHF)
MS SciBeta HFI US Equity 6F EW (USD) UCITS ETF (USUF)
MS SciBeta HFE EM Equity 6F EW UCITS ETF (EMHF)

MS SciBeta HFE Japan Equity 6F EW UCITS ETF (JHEF)
MS SciBeta HFE Pacific ex-Jap Equity 6F EW UCITS ETF (PHEF)
The ETFs have total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.30%, with total assets of the individual funds sitting between $1 million and less than $3 million.
The ETFs look to capture six factors, value, size, low volatility, high momentum, low investment and high profitability.
It highlights how smart beta ETFs have fallen out of popularity, with the asset class suffering outflows of $1.7 billion (1.5 billion euros) in the first quarter of 2024.
Last year, Northern Trust Asset Management closed four of its five factor ETFs, before Waystone ETFs agreed to take over its Irish platform and its one remaining ETF in June.
The group entered the U.S. ETF market last year and now looks to be focusing its ETF efforts solely on the market.
The multi-factor range lost 91.7% of its assets in 2023 after amassing $334 million (300million euros) in its first five years. USHF held $224 million in assets under management on the closure of MS Scientific Beta US Equity Factors UCITS ETF (USEF) in October 2022.
Morgan Stanley shut USEF in 2022 with less than $1 million AUM, and previously closed the MS Scientific Beta Global Equity Factors UCITS ETF (GEF) which delisted in Aug. 2021.

DIA,2024-08-16,Traders now betting on smaller Fed rate cut in September,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/traders-now-betting-smaller-fed-121923762.html,"Investing.com -- The likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut at the September 2024 meeting is all but guaranteed. However, the question now centers around whether the Fed will cut 25 basis points (bps) or follow through with a jumbo 50 bps cut. Traders have adjusted probabilities over the last week based on new economic data points.
The probability of a target rate of 4.75 - 5.00 at the September 18, 2024 meeting, or a 50 bps cut, is now 32% versus a 53% probability of a jumbo cut last week, according to the latest CME futures prices. On the other hand, the odds of a target rate of 5.00 - 5.25, which would represent a decrease of 25 bps from the current rate, have risen to 68% from a 47% probability the previous week.
Overall, the data shows that while the odds were essentially even last week between the two potential cuts, traders are now mainly betting on the smaller of the two cuts.
The Federal Reserve uses interest rate adjustments as a tool to control inflation and stabilize the economy. A rate cut can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, while a rate hike can slow down an overheating economy and keep inflation in check.
Recent economic data is driving the shifting probabilities for the September 2024 meeting. This week, both the PPI and CPI posted positive inflation readings. Meanwhile, recent stronger-than-expected retail sales data supports the view of a soft landing and a smaller cut.
After the recent sell-off, including last Monday's dramatic swoon, stocks have bounced back strongly as the soft landing theory continues to gain steam.

The disruptions, reporting by outage tracking website Downdetector.com, coincided with a sharp sell-off in U.S. stocks driven by recession concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 plunged 12% in its worst day since the 1987 Black Monday crash, highlighting the global nature of the market decline.
ETF Performance Reflects Market Volatility
The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) fell 2.6%, while the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) dropped 3.3%. The ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VIXY), which tracks market volatility, surged 33%.
Fears of a U.S recession were the primary driver of the global market meltdown, following Friday’s disappointing July jobs report. Investors are also concerned that the Federal Reserve may delay cutting interest rates, potentially prolonging an economic slowdown.
The trading platform outages affected users across multiple brokerages. According to Downdector, Schwab had issues reported for more than 15,000 people, while Fidelity saw reports for over 3,700 users. Vanguard had more than 2,800 people reporting problems and TD Ameritrade has reports from nearly 2,000 users.

DIA,2024-08-02,Probability of 50 bps rate cut more than doubled after payroll data,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/probability-50-bps-rate-cut-134801040.html,"The probability of a 50 basis point rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve has more than doubled among traders following Friday's weak payroll data. Nonfarm payrolls for July were 114,000, well below the consensus of 177,000 and the lowest since January 2021. In addition, the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%, up from 4.1%.
The upcoming meeting, slated for September 18, 2024, has seen a significant shift in probabilities. A target rate of 4.75 - 5.00, 50 bps below the current rate, now has a current probability of 63%. This is a substantial increase from a previous day probability of 28% and a previous week probability of just 10.7%. The probability was at 31% before today's payroll data.
This shift suggests a possible decrease of 50 basis points (bps) from the current rate. If this change occurs, it would be a significant move by the Federal Reserve, reflecting a more dovish stance towards monetary policy.
On the other hand, the probability for a target rate of 5.00 - 5.25, which 25 bps below the current rate but less so, has decreased. The current probability for this rate is now at 37%, down from the previous day's probability of 72% and the previous week's probability of 89.1%.
These shifts in probabilities indicate that traders are increasingly betting on a double rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

DIA,2024-07-24,Fed's Dudley now calling for Fed rate cut next week amid recession concerns,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-dudley-now-calling-fed-143317350.html,"Investing.com -- Former New York Federal Reserve President Bill Dudley on Wednesday called for the Fed to cut rates as soon as next week amid recession concerns, reversing his long-held view for the U.S. central bank to persist with its higher for longer rate regime.
""The facts have changed, so I’ve changed my mind. The Fed should cut, preferably at next week’s policy-making meeting,"" Dudley said in a Bloomberg op-ed piece ahead of the Fed's July 30-31 policy meeting.
For a long while, the strength in the U.S. economy suggested the Fed wasn't doing enough to slow growth as the stock market surged and financial conditions remained loose -- but those facts have now changed.
""Now, the Fed’s efforts to cool the economy are having a visible effect,"" Dudley said, flagging that lower income households are feeling the impact of higher rates on their credit cards and auto loans at time when the labor market is cooling.
The signs of slowing growth are appearing in the the labor market, Dudley adds, expressing concern about the three-month average unemployment rate rising 0.43% from its low point in the prior 12 months to a rate that could spark a recession.
This rate is now very close to ""the 0.5% threshold that, as identified by the Sahm Rule, has invariably signaled a US recession,"" the former NY Fed president said.
Dudley concerns about the labor market aren't without merit as Fed chairman Jerome Powell also signaled recently that softening in the labor market now warranted a closer eye.
“Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” Powell said earlier this month in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, noting that the ""labor market has cooled really significantly across so many measures.""
Inflation, meanwhile, continues to slow to the Fed's target. The Fed’s preferred consumer-price indicator, the core deflator for personal consumption expenditures, was up 2.6% in May from a year earlier, not ""far above the central bank’s 2% objective,"" Dudley added.
Dudley acknowledges that the Fed may not want to cut rates too soon and bear the risk of inflation rising once again, while the Sahm Rule isn't something that holds sway at the Fed discussion table yet.
At its meeting next week, the voting Fed members are expected to vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%.
About 95% of traders expect the Fed to keep interest rates steady at the July meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

DIA,2024-07-09,Does SPY and Its 18% Rise Reflect U.S. Markets?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-spy-18-rise-reflect-205114548.html,"Depending upon which ETF you look at, the U.S. stock market’s performance so far this year has been tepid, fantastic or more likely, somewhere in between.
The world’s largest exchange-traded fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has broken record highs on its way to gaining 18% this year, just past the year's midway point.

Seen through a different lens, the market’s performance looks much less impressive. The narrower SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) is up just 5.1% year-to-date. DIA’s return is similar to 4.7% gain for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), while it’s far superior to the mere 0.9% return for the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM).

The wide-ranging returns for various U.S. stock market ETFs is a reflection of the current environment which has favored megacap tech companies above all else. 

One stock alone—Nvidia—has boosted SPY’s return by almost 500 basis points, while high interest rates have weighed on the profitability of many of the smaller companies that make up IWM.

Of course, IWM is hardly reflective of the overall U.S. stock market. The combined market cap of the Russell 2000 index is $2.8 trillion, less than Nvidia on its own.

But the Dow Jones, as imperfect as it is, has historically been a decent indicator of how the stock market is faring. And maybe it still is.

DIA’s return matches that of RSP, an ETF which tracks a version of the S&P 500 where every holding is equally weighted. It puts much less emphasis on the giant companies that dominate the traditional S&P 500.

The gap between SPY and RSP is currently around 1,300 basis points, which would be the second-largest performance differential for the ETFs since RSP’s inception in 2003 (in 2009, RSP soared almost 45%, trouncing the 26% gain for SPY).

Which ETF is more indicative of the performance of the U.S. stock market is open for debate. While the traditional S&P 500 tracked by SPY is the most widely-followed index of U.S. stocks, if the index continues to outperform its equal-weighted counterpart by leaps and bounds due to the incredible performance of a handful of stocks, an increasing number of investors may question whether it truly represents the stock market at large.

DIA,2024-06-20,"Economic Data Deluge: Claims, Starts, Philly Fed & More",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/economic-data-deluge-claims-starts-142300859.html,"Thursday, June 20th, 2024

We come back refreshed from the Juneteenth holiday this morning with more economic data. A lot more economic data. From the labor market to homebuilding figures to regional manufacturing and a new account balance, we fill in a lot of gaps ahead of today’s opening bell. Pre-market futures were in the green ahead of this onslaught of data, and remain so afterward — though they seem to be dwindling a bit.

Initial Jobless Claims moderated week over week. A headline 238K was slightly above estimates for 235K, but down from the prior week’s upwardly revised 243K, which is now the highest print we’ve seen since last August. We spent from last fall to this spring with new jobless claims sub-220K in all but a few select weeks, which was an historically robust employment period. We’re now notably above this, but appear to only have buoyed back to where we were last summer.

Continuing Claims are reported a week in arrears from new claims. Thus, we tend to see last week’s initial claims data reflected in this week’s Continuing Claims, and this woulds stand to reason: a headline 1.828 million longer-term jobless claims is the highest single-week level we’ve seen since November of 2021. This follows a slightly downwardly revised 1.813 million — the first time we’ve seen back-to-back 1.8 million prints since the first week of February.

Housing Starts for May missed expectations. A total of 1.277 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units is the lowest tally we’ve seen since June of 2020 — right in the heart of the Covid pandemic. It’s lower than the 1.38 million analysts were expecting, and notably below the 1.5 million or so housing starts we’d been seeing over the last few years. Single-family housing starts fell -5.2% for the month, down nearly -2% year over year. Mortgage rates in May remained above 7%, and homebuilder sentiment has fallen in May (and June, as of yesterday’s survey).

Building Permits, also for May, hit lows not seen since June 2020, as well. Headline 1.386 million was well off the expected pace of 1.45 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units. Building Permits are a good gauge of future Housing Starts, so weakness on this metric does not bode well for a bounce-back a month from now on new starts. Oversupply in the multi-family space has led to a -52% drawdown in starts year over year, and we’re not seeing permits doing much heavy lifting as of now.

The latest Philly Fed manufacturing survey, for June, is also out this morning. It’s +1.3 is below the +5.0 analysts had been anticipating, and the unrevised +4.5 reported for the previous month, but it does make the fifth month in a row of positive Philly Fed numbers, following five negative months in a row prior. A year ago, Philly Fed registered a -13.6, bottoming out before that in April of last year at -26.3 — the lowest read we’d seen since plummeting during Covid.

Finally, the Q1 U.S. Current Account data is released this morning. This fell to -$237.6 billion, far lower than the -$207.4 billion anticipated and the downwardly revised -$221.8 billion the prior month. Over the past five years, the deepest cut to the U.S. account came back in Q1 of 2022, when it reached -$291.8 billion, which is also an all-time low. We’d like to see this flow back the other direction, but there isn’t much that will be directly impacted by this drop in the near-term economy.

DIA,2024-06-17,"Fed, Powell Lay Out Inflation Expectations",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-powell-lay-inflation-expectations-223700088.html,"Wednesday, June 12th, 2024

This trading session was, in some ways, the story of two shoes dropping. The first, ahead of today’s open, was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May, which came in better than expected: 0.0% month over month (decidedly not inflationary), and +3.3% on the year-over-year Inflation Rate: 20 basis points (bps) below the April tally. The second shoe to drop is the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting the afternoon, where the Fed unsurprisingly kept interest rates unchanged from the 5.25-5.50% level we’ve had since last summer.

The Fed sees economic activity continuing at a solid pace. Job gains are still considered strong. Progress on inflation has been made, albeit modestly. The committee maintains its +2% inflation objective, and says it sees a better balance on inflation metrics than a year ago — largely due to restrictive interest rate policy. In 2022, the Fed raised rates +425 bps, and another +100 bps in 2023. We’re still awaiting the first move of 2024, obviously.

The Fed continues to remark that the economic outlook is still uncertain. It still says it won’t start cutting interest rates until inflation moves more “sustainably” toward +2%. In today’s statement, the monetary policy body also said it would make adjustments to current policy if new economic risks emerge. You might read this as, “We’re going to keep everything tight for now, but if something breaks, we will respond.”

In the press conference directly following the FOMC release, Fed Chair Powell articulated these positions. He began by once again saying the body only makes decisions meeting by meeting, and are not going to get ahead of themselves — least of all in speculating on what month rates might finally start coming down. We’re “very data dependent,” Powell said. “We saw today’s CPI report as progress and building confidence, but it does not warrant changing policy at this time.”

The Fed’s favored inflation metric is the PCE report, which comes out at the end of this month. PCE stands for Personal Consumption Expenditures, of course, and the +2.7% reported for April he said “is a good place to be.” Powell said that no one on the committee has any interest rate hikes as their base-case scenario, going forward. “It’s pretty clear policy is restrictive and having the effects we’d hoped for.”

The main sticking point for Powell, and presumably the rest of the Fed, is the relative ambiguity of falling inflation rates. He noted that the labor force supply has come up “quite a bit,” with both job openings and quits coming down. Unemployment has elevated 60 bps over the past year — and this remains consistent with the “soft landing” scenario the Fed has been attempting to conjure for more than two years now. “We’re getting good results here,” Powell said. “It’s just gonna happen more slowly than we thought.”

FBL,2024-09-13,Single-Stock ETFs to Tackle Global Currency Risk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/single-stock-etfs-tackle-global-201201893.html,"The popular single-stock ETF category is about to embark on a global twist, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Precidian Investments is in the final regulatory approval stages for 18 single-stock ETFs that will offer access to non-U.S. companies listed on foreign stock exchanges.
Unlike the single-stock ETFs that have attracted about $13 billion over the past two years by offering leveraged and inverse exposure to individual companies, the Precidian ETFs will not be levered in any way. They will use currency swaps to hedge out currency risk that impact performance when investing in foreign companies even through American Depository Receipts.
“This is plugging a huge gap in the market,” said Stuart Thomas, founding principal at Precidian Investments in Newtown, Pa.
Currently, U.S. investors buying stock in companies like Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium or Toyota Motor Corp. in Japan have a choice of ADRs or foreign ordinary shares, both of which introduce currency risk that is often ignored or overlooked, Thomas said.
He cited Toyota as an example of the potential currency impact.
“Over the last decade, local shares of Toyota outperformed the ADRs by about 4.5% a year as the yen got clobbered against the strength of the U.S. dollar,” Thomas said.
Precidian, which has until now specialized in intellectual property and licensing, is new to the ETF space, but Thomas sees an opportunity across the investing landscape.
“It’s an educational process, because most investors, including some professionals, think by buying these ADRs on U.S. exchanges they don’t have currency exposure,” Thomas said.
Interest in Leveraged, Inverse Strategies Grows
Aniket Ullal, vice president of data analytics at CFRA and a member of the etf.com advisory board, said single-stock ETFs have been riding a wave of interest in leveraged and inverse strategies.
However, he isn’t convinced a currency hedging feature will gain the same kind of appeal among investors.
“Currency hedging is less important now than it was a year or two ago when we saw significant differentials,” he said. “It’s an interesting category, but it feels like this would have been good to have a year ago.”
Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store in Overland Park, Kans., said the popularity of single-stock ETFs is such that “issuers are incentivized to try their hand here.”
“It makes sense that they would look globally for stocks that might capture the imagination of investors,” he added. “From an ETF issuer’s perspective, launching these products is essentially like buying lottery tickets.”

FBL,2024-04-25,"Meta ETFs Plunge on Sales Outlook, AI Spending",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-etfs-plunge-sales-outlook-200636975.html,"Shares of Meta Platforms Inc. sold off hard on Thursday, dragging down exchange-traded funds holding large stakes in the social media company, after it said revenue this quarter will be less than expected and that it would boost spending on artificial intelligence projects.
Meta fell as much as 16% before retracing some losses as investors used the drop as an opportunity to buy.
The $18 billion Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC), which has 29% of its portfolio in Meta, was down 4% shortly after noon.
The leveraged GraniteShares 2x Long META Daily ETF (FBL) was last trading down by 24%.
The company behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp reported earnings and revenues for the first quarter that were solidly above expectations.
Earnings per share for Q1 came in at $4.71, above the $4.31 that analysts were expecting. Revenues of $36.5 billion were also above expectations of $36.1 billion.
However, investors took issue with revenue guidance for the second quarter. At the midpoint, the company’s estimate for Q2 revenue of $37.75 billion was slightly below the $38.2 billion that analysts were expecting.
Some investors were caught off guard by the forecast, especially since Meta had been beating estimates and raising guidance over the past several quarters.
Those beat and raise quarters had powered the stock to a 40% gain in the year-to-date period leading up the latest earnings report and a 136% gain over the past year.
Accelerating Investments
But it wasn’t just the Q2 revenue guidance that disappointed investors.
Meta increased its expense outlook for 2024. Expenses are forecast to be $96 billion-to-$99 billion, up from the firm’s prior outlook of $94 billion-to-$99 billion “due to higher infrastructure and legal costs,” and they may continue to rise in 2025 and beyond. 

“While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” the company wrote in a press release.  

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg elaborated on the higher expenses in his earnings conference call remarks. 

“I expect to see a multi‐year investment cycle before we've fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs, and more into the profitable services I expect,” he said, while adding that the company might not realize the benefits of those investments immediately. 

Zuckerberg went on to say that Meta stock has “historically seen a lot of volatility…during this phase of our product playbook—where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.”

JEPI,2024-09-24,Active ETF Adoption in Europe in Early Stages: Survey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/active-etf-adoption-europe-early-120000273.html,"Little over a third of European fund selectors allocate or are planning to allocate to active ETFs, according to a Research in Finance survey.
The European Fund Selector Survey, interviewing 900 retail, institutional third-party fund buyers and distributors, found only 21% of European selectors currently allocate to active ETFs, with a further 13% planning to do so by the end of 2024.
The figures underscore that the European active ETF market is very much still in its nascent stages, with the European active ETF market's $34bn assets under management still representing a small fraction of the $2trn wider market. Education is also likely to play a role in uptake, with 22% of the market completely unfamiliar with active ETFs.
BlackRock is projecting the active ETF market to reach $4 trillion by 2030, more than quadrupling in size from its current levels, according to a July report from the asset manager. Active ETFs listed globally reached a new milestone in July, with assets under management climbing to $974.3 billion, according to data from London-based ETFGI, an independent research and consultancy firm.
Regionally, Switzerland are they most positive on the product class, with 28% of investors surveyed allocating to active ETFs, followed by Spain and Germany at 27%, respectively.
Europe Active ETF Market Lags U.S.
The market is still well behind the U.S. in terms of market share, accounting for 31% of flows into active ETFs in May alone.
Research in Finance said several factors including lack of tax advantages, incompatibility of business models and lack of availability through European brokerage platforms.
ETF Stream’s Quarterly Buyer Barometer, which identified several reasons for fund selectors being hesitant to allocate to active ETFs.
Investors cited a limited range of products (25%) and tracking error (21%) as challenges to increase their exposure to active ETFs, with one ETF buyer also citing a lack of transparency surrounding the investment process as a reason for their reluctance to allocate.

JEPI,2024-09-20,SPY's Big Outflows Hamper State Street: Morningstar,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spys-big-outflows-hamper-state-192918929.html,"In the race for ETF supremacy, third-place State Street Global Advisors is being hamstrung this year by its flagship fund, the $558 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).
The world's first and largest exchange-traded fund has bled a net $26.9 billion so far this year, pinching State Street's overall flows and widening its standings in the league tables behind larger rivals, No. 1 BlackRock Inc. and No. 2 Vanguard Group.
According to the latest data from Morningstar, SSGA’s net ETF inflows this year through August totaled $8.1 billion, including net outflows of $3.9 billion for U.S. equity ETFs and $300 million for municipal bond ETFs. BlackRock's iShares took in $145.5 billion over the same period while Vanguard led all firms with a $174.8 billion haul.
""Recent flows have been shaky for State Street Global Advisors,"" the Morningstar report said. ""Whiplash flows to and from SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF SPY and tepid interest in sector equity ETFs have weighed on State Street’s bottom line, too.
At more than $3 trillion across 414 ETFs, iShares is the largest issuer, followed by Vanguard with $2.6 trillion across 86 ETFs. SSGA has $1.3 trillion under management across 137 ETFs.
Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, took issue with the Morningstar data, claiming it as “a little bit of an incomplete report.”
“There are seasonality and structural trends that typically drive flows into SPY in the November and December timeframe,” he said, adding that the ETF took in “$50 billion last year during those two months.”
SPY a ""Unicorn""
“SPY has the fourth-most flows of any ETF, and it is a unicorn; a legit one of one,” he added. Bartolini said SPY’s size and liquidity has established it as a “very diverse use case, related to optionality and derivatives trading.”
“SPY trades roughly $25 billion a day,” he said. “No other ETF has ever come close to it, nor ever will.”
Ryan Jackson, senior manager research analyst at Morningstar, confirmed that “SPY has definitely seen better inflows and asset growth at the end of the year.”
According to Morningstar, from 2014 through 2023, SPY’s average fourth-quarter net inflow was $16 billion.
Jackson acknowledged the variability of flows into SPY as a unique trading vehicle, but said SSGA is also losing ground to iShares and Vanguard due to a smaller footprint in the increasingly popular categories of fixed income and actively managed ETFs.
Worst Year Since 2018?
On that point, Bartolini responded that, “Our fixed income lineup is pretty broad based and our active lineup, which is more in the fixed income arena, covers core and core plus.”

JEPI,2024-09-18,ETFs' Drain on Mutual Funds Shows No Sign of Slowing,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etfs-drain-mutual-funds-shows-200430364.html,"Exchange-traded funds continue to gobble up market share from mutual funds, according to the latest report from Morningstar.
Investors poured a net $69.3 billion into ETFs while pulling $43.2 billion from mutual funds. That continues a longer-term trend, including the first eight months of the year, in which ETFs raked in $588.1 billion and mutual funds bled $217 billion, the report said.
In terms of where the money is going, the data show a growing appeal for fixed income in August as the financial markets braced for the first interest cut by the Federal Reserve in more than four years.
According to the Morningstar report, active and passive taxable bond mutual funds and ETFs combined for $33 billion worth of net inflows in August, effectively carrying mutual fund and ETF inflows to $26 billion in August.
While U.S. equity fund inflows were essentially flat during the month, international equity funds recorded their worst month of the year in terms of asset flows, with approximately $8 billion moving out the door in August.
Municipal bond funds also had a strong month, taking in $5.54 billion and marking the first time more than $5 billion flowed into the funds in consecutive months in three years.
On a year-to-date basis through August, No. 2 issuer Vanguard Group is leading with $174.8 billion in net inflows, followed by BlackRock's iShares, as the No. 1 issuer has hauled in $145.5 billion. State Street, issuer of the SPDR funds and the third-largest ETF manager, has brought in $8.1 billion this year.
Ryan Jackson, senior manager research analyst at Morningstar, attributed the State Street’s woes to a combination of factors, including “the variability of flows into and out of” the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).
Other factors hampering State Street when competing against the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard, Jackson added is the smaller bond ETF footprint at a time when bond ETFs are gaining appeal and a fewer active ETFs.

JEPI,2024-09-18,JPMorgan Active ETF Hits $10B European Landmark,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-active-etf-hits-10b-120000044.html,"A JPMorgan Chase & Co. exchange-traded fund is the first active ETF to hit $10 billion assets under management in Europe.
The JPM US Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) UCITS ETF (JREU) has pulled in $3.6 billion so far this year, with assets swelling $1.8 billion over the last three months, according to data from TrackInsight. JREU's managers aim to outpace the S&P500 by slightly overweighting companies with the highest potential to outperform and underweights companies considered the most overvalued. Managers also take into account environmental, social and governance issues and how they may affect cash flows at firms in which they invest.
“Our research enhanced index strategy has successfully been delivering value to investors for over 35 years,"" said Travis Spence, JP Morgan Asset Management's global head of ETFs. ""Combining it into the ETF vehicle has made the strategy more accessible for many types of investors.""
Spence was named JP Morgan Asset Management's head of ETFs Aug. 16. The 20-year veteran is based in London and reports to CIO and global head of asset management solutions Jed Laskowitz.
JREU's 19% gain so far this year is roughly equal to the performance of the S&P 500 tracking SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). According to the S&P Dow Jones Indices’ SPIVA Europe scorecard, 71% of active U.S. equity funds failed to meet the S&P 500's returns in one year.
Active ETFs are the catalyst for the growth of the European ETF market, gathering $6.8bn inflows in the first half of 2024.
Since its inception in 2018, JP Morgan Asset Management has cornered 42.5% of the active ETF market. The firm manages $31.9bn AUM in European ETFs, a small fraction of its $165.84bn American ETF business.
The New York-based firm manages 64 ETFs, including the $35.1 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), it's largest fund. If JREU was a U.S. fund, it would be JPMorgan's fifth largest, just above the $7.17 JPMorgan BetaBuilders Canada ETF (BBCA).

According to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York-based financial services giant has proposed a JPMorgan Flexible Income ETF (JFLI), which will seek to seek to balance income and growth.
The ETF will have a net expense ratio of 0.35% after fee waivers, according to the filing. It will invest in a broad range of income-producing securities, including debt and equity in U.S. and global markets, both developed and emerging.
JPMorgan Aims for Maximized Returns
JPMorgan Investment Management Inc., the fund’s advisor, will have the ability to allocate its portfolio into a range of assets, the filing stated. The fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in underlying funds that primarily invest in debt securities.
According to the filing, the proposed ETF may invest up to 90% of its total assets in equity securities, including common stocks and real estate investment trusts. It can also invest up to 70% in junk bonds and up to 35% in loan assignments and participations.
JP Morgan Asset Management also announced the liquidation of the JPMorgan BetaBuilders U.S. TIPS 0-5 Year ETF (BBIP) and JPMorgan BetaBuilders 1-5 Year U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (BBSA), according to a press release. BBIP and BBSA have $1.5 million and $14.5 million in assets under management, according to etf.com data.
etf.com
The last day of trading for both funds on the Cboe BZX Exchange will be Oct. 18, with liquidation set for Oct. 25, the company said. Shareholders who continue to hold shares on the liquidation date will receive cash equal to the net asset value of their shares.
These changes come as JPMorgan continues to expand its ETF presence. According to etf.com data, the firm currently manages 64 ETFs traded on U.S. markets, with total assets under management of $165.8 billion.

JEPI,2024-08-19,Goldman Sachs Hires Fixed Income PM from JPM,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-hires-fixed-income-191503551.html,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., in the midst building out its $34.6 billion ETF business, hired J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Alvaro Quiros as a fixed income exchange-traded fund portfolio manager.
Based in London, Quiros will be responsible for managing Goldman's range of fixed income ETFs and building on the firm’s expertise in areas such as active fixed income and sustainability, the company said. He'll focus on ETFs issued outside of the U.S. Previously, Quiros spent six years at J.P. Morgan, including a period in fixed income ETF portfolio management roles.
Goldman Sachs has been adding new leadership and funds to its ETF business, expanding its franchise as rival investment banks, high-profile investors and other financial services firms seek to enter the rapidly growing field. ETFs are widely expected to hit $10 trillion in assets next year, after just barely 30 years since the first was issued, thanks in part to the investment vehicles successfully snatching market share from mutual funds
Goldman, which manages 44 U.S.-issued funds, last month installed Byron Lake as chief transformation officer for Goldman’s Client Solutions Group after Lake helped J.P. Morgan develop its ETF business into the sixth-largest in the U.S. New York-based J.P. Morgan has with 62 U.S. funds with assets of $160.2 billion, nearly five times those of Goldman Sachs.
Goldman Sachs' ETF Launches
Lake replaced outgoing ETF head Mike Crinieri at Goldman. The leadership reshuffle also saw Goldman's Europe/Middle East/Asia ETF head Peter Thompson retire in May.
Goldman has launched a handful of ETFs over the past year, including four muni bond funds at the end of July, and started a so-called accelerator aimed at helping other firms get their exchange-traded funds to market.
Last week, J.P. Morgan promoted Travis Spence to global head of ETFs with immediate effect.
""Lots of exciting work ahead to expand our fixed income ETF business!,"" Quiros wrote on his LinkedIn page. Before working at J.P. Morgan, Quiros began his career with two years as an analyst at DWS covering ETF and index investing.

JEPI,2024-08-16,JPMorgan AM Names Travis Spence Global ETF Head,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-am-names-travis-spence-184657895.html,"Travis Spence
JP Morgan Asset Management named veteran Travis Spence to lead its global exchange-traded funds business, which manages $190 billion in 102 ETFs worldwide.
Based in London and reporting to CIO and global head of asset management solutions Jed Laskowitz, Spence will lead ETF product development, capital markets, the firm’s newly formed ETF insights division and continue to head ETF distribution across EMEA. Spence, who has been at the firm for 20 years, takes the post immediately.
Spence is part of the asset management unit of New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co., the sixth-largest U.S. ETF issuer, with $156.4 billion in 64 U.S.-issued ETFs.
The move comes after the company extended its lead in Europe’s nascent active ETF market since Spence was appointed head of EMEA ETF distribution in March 2023.
By the end of this year's first half, the firm claimed $21.6 billion, nearly half, of the $44.3 billion in active ETFs in Europe, booking $5.7 billion inflows during the first half of the year.
Over his two decades at JP Morgan, Spence has operated across a number of leadership positions including managing director of fixed income, currencies and commodities, as well as head of strategic communications and liquidity for the firm’s APAC business.
“Under Travis’s leadership, we are confident that our ETF franchise will continue to innovate and help our clients achieve their goals,' Laskowitz said in the statement that announced Spence's new role. “We are committed to revolutionizing the landscape by providing the highest quality active ETFs in the industry.
Spence’s promotion follows the departure of former global ETF head Bryon Lake for Goldman Sachs Asset Management in May, after former GSAM ETF head Mike Crinieri left the firm earlier this year.
JPMorgan Active ETFs
New York-based JP Morgan arrived relatively late to the ETF industry, issuing its first funds a decade ago in 2014, Laskowitz told etf.com. He said the firm is particularly focused on active ETFs due to client interest in those products.
""We’ve doubled down on our ETF business in the last five years,"" he said. ""Our clients are interested in ETFs, active ETFs are growing twice the rate of passive. Five years ago active ETFs made up 3% of the industry, today it's 8% in terms of assets.""
The $33.4 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) is the company's largest ETF.

JEPI,2024-07-26,Goldman Sachs' ETF Growth in Focus as Lake Arrives,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-etf-growth-focus-185226910.html,"ETF veteran Byron Lake arrives at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Monday as the asset manager is in the midst of building out it's $35.5 billion exchange-traded fund unit. 

Lake is credited with helping build JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ETF business into the sixth-largest, with 62 funds and assets of $160.2 billion, nearly five times those of Goldman Sachs'. While he'll have a broader mandate than exchange-traded funds—his title is chief transformation officer for Goldman’s Client Solutions Group—his arrival signals Goldman's focus on the growing ETF industry.
Goldman is a top 20 ETF issuer, with 43 funds.
His appointment follows recent departures in Goldman’s ETF business, including global ETF head Mark Crinieri earlier this year. He arrives on the heels of Goldman launching a handful of ETFs over the past year, including four muni bond funds this week, and starting a so-called accelerator aimed at helping other firms get their exchange-traded funds to market.
While Lake’s background is rooted in ETFs, his new role at Goldman Sachs appears to have a broader scope. He'll will work with leadership across a variety of business units to deliver advice, design portfolio solutions, and extend Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s suite of investment strategies to institutional investors and wealth management clients, according to a statement released early this week.
Byron Lake's Broader Role Beyond ETFs
Deborah Fuhr, founder of London-based ETF research firm ETFGI, noted the potentially expansive nature of Lake’s role.
“It seems like the role is broader than just ETFs,” Fuhr said, adding that it could possibly have been left intentionally not narrowly defined because the industry is rapidly transforming. Fuhr is a member of the etf.com advisory board.
Lake starts at Goldman as ETFs grow globally, with worldwide assets hitting a record $13.1 trillion at the end of June, according to Fuhr, and expectations that new full year inflows will hit a record.
During his tenure at JPMorgan, Lake oversaw growth in the bank’s ETF business, particularly in active ETFs. The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) grew into a wildly popular $34 billion behemoth during his tenure, netting more than $13 billion since the beginning of last year.
Fuhr highlighted the evolving ETF landscape as a key factor in Lake’s appointment.
“The opportunity set is broader than just ETFs. It’s figuring out how to design solutions for clients in different geographies,"" she said, adding that areas like tokenization and AI-driven research could play roles in future asset management strategies.

JEPI,2024-05-10,Defiance Unveils Income Generating Oil Fund,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defiance-unveils-income-generating-oil-211238510.html,"Defiance ETFs, the themes-focused issuer often known for making bold options plays, unveiled its first oil and income focused fund on Friday to address investor demand for a variety of income generating products.
The Defiance Oil Enhanced Options Income ETF (USOY), which is actively managed, uses put options to offer investors income as well as indirect exposure to the United States Oil Fund (USO), the largest pure play oil fund in the United States.
“Traders invested in the commodity could potentially benefit from not only the price of oil, but also the additional premium our fund may achieve through selling slightly in the money puts,” explained Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs.
Options ETFs' popularity has surged over the past year, partially due to the success of the $33 billion JPMorgan Premium Income (JEPI), which brought in nearly $13 billion in inflows last year.
Defiance, which was founded in 2018, has nine ETFs trading with about $1.4 billion in assets. The issuer employs strategies such as options and leverage in many of its funds, including the Defiance Nasdaq 100 Enhanced Options Income ETF (QQQY), as well as the Defiance R2000 Enhanced Options Income ETF (IWMY). 
Oil Prices in 2024
Amid geopolitical instability and shortened supply, oil prices climbed earlier in the year, making ETFs in the energy category some of 2024's best performers.
Yet over the past month, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures declined about 7%, even as the United States Oil Fund (USO) gained roughly 1%. This disparity could be due to the cost of product remaining high despite the spot price of oil falling, according to reporting from etf.com's Jeff Benjamin.
Jablonski highlighted that with oil and energy down over 2023, ETFs in the sector are still “proving to have investment return potential in ’24,” she said.
The largest Defiance ETF is the Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG), which has $542.3 million in assets under management.

JEPI,2024-05-09,JEPI vs DIVO: Active Alternatives to Dividend ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jepi-vs-divo-active-alternatives-120000355.html,"Investors love dividend ETFs and active management is on the rise.
Those two themes create a powerful match.
While investors are unlikely to fall out of love with the largest dividend exchange-traded funds, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), they have been seeking equity income alternatives.
For dividend ETF alternatives, investors are choosing active management to capture attractive yields while minimizing downside risks. A prime example is the largest actively managed ETF, the $33 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI).
JEPI holds equity linked notes and writes covered call options to provide high income while attempting to produce the same return as the S&P 500 Index with lower volatility. While this strategy tends to cap upside potential, JEPI’s price performance and yield have both outpaced bonds in the past three years.
JEPI’s popularity has driven investors to similar strategies. For example, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (DIVO) attempts to provide above-average yields with a combination of dividends and option premiums.
In a market environment of low dividend yields and increasing downside risks for equities, actively managed income ETFs like JEPI and DIVO are likely to remain popular alternatives to traditional dividend ETFs.

Performance: DIVO’s dividend equity exposure helps it win the performance battle with a year-to-date gain of nearly 7%, compared to JEPI’s gain of just over 5%. DIVO also wins the 1-year return while both ETFs have similar 3-year returns.
AUM: JEPI is the largest active ETF with $33 billion in assets under management while DIVO is smaller but still respectable at just over $3 billion.
Expense ratio: JEPI’s expenses are lower at 0.35% while DIVO’s expense ratio is 0.56%.
For a full breakdown of these equity income ETFs, see the JEPI vs DIVO ETF analysis with etf.com’s comparison tool.
Bottom Line on Covered Call ETFs
Covered call ETFs like JEPI and DIVO can be appropriate for investors seeking income and a hedge against volatility. However, they should consider the risks associated with the strategy, including market risk and counterparty risk. As with any investment, investors should carefully evaluate their investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon before investing in these funds.

JEPI,2024-05-06,Active ETFs: The Death of Smart Beta?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/active-etfs-death-smart-beta-120000978.html,"The rise of active ETFs in Europe has sparked questions about the role of smart beta within multi-asset portfolios, an asset class that has struggled to gain traction over the past decade.
Active investing is the latest trend to take the European ETF market by storm as investors pile into quantitative-driven ETFs from the likes of JP Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) and Fidelity International.
According to data from Morningstar, active ETFs saw €2.1b billon flows in Q1, taking the segment’s overall assets under management (AUM) to €33.6 billion, up from €5.7 billion at the start of 2015.
Last quarter was a different story for smart beta ETFs which suffered €1.5 billion outflows as investors turned away from value and risk-orientated products.
The asset class has never exceeded 8% market share of European ETFs, a sign it has “reached its potential”, according to Monika Calay, director, manager research, at Morningstar.
Smart beta ETFs that offer exposure to factors such as value, size or low volatility have often left investors disappointed due to their high correlation with their parent benchmarks and higher fees.
Active ETFs vs Smart Beta
According to analysis conducted by Finominal, many smart beta ETFs have a correlation of more than 0.9 to the S&P 500, highlighting the potential construction challenges of creating a long-only factor exposure.
In response, active ETFs have launched with the promise of incremental outperformance via a quantitative-driven approach to stock selection.
These strategies have resonated the most with investors as highlighted by the JPM US Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) UCITS ETF (JREU) which has ballooned to $7.1 billion AUM since launching in October 2018, the largest active ETF in Europe.
“In Europe, the active ETF landscape is biased toward lower-alpha, lower-active share products, as well as quantitative and sustainability-tilted products, in both equities and fixed income,” Calay explained.
“Given that an increasing number of active managers are considering the merits of packaging and distributing their investment strategies in an ETF format, we expect the menu of available options to expand significantly as new entrants join the race.”
Calay said switching from a smart beta to an active approach allows flexibility to navigate changing market environments and “exploit pockets of value” that are not captured in a rules-based approach.
One example of this came in late in 2020 after Pfizer announced positive vaccine results, a move that drove outperformance in value stocks. However, BlackRock’s momentum ETFs were unable to capture this switch from growth to value until May 2021 when the underlying index rebalanced.

JEPI,2024-05-02,Avantis Growing Fast For The Right Reasons: Allan Roth,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avantis-growing-fast-reasons-allan-120000440.html,"I often write about avoiding ETFs that have been on a hot streak such as Cathie Wood's ARK funds, whose fund family quickly grew to about $35 billion in assets before losing two-thirds due to performance and fund outflows. Concentrated portfolios and high fees typically don’t work in the long run.
The Avantis story is different and is likely to produce a better outcome for investors. This new ETF family started in late 2019 and today has over $43.4 billion in assets in 28 funds with an average annual expense ratio of 0.24%. In a little over four years, Avantis has grown from scratch to be the 15th largest issuer of ETFs.
Avantis was founded by former executives of Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA). Both DFA and Avantis follow a semi-passive strategy with low fees and low turnover. Low turnover isn’t no turnover so Avantis chose the ETF platform as its primary fund wrapper as the creation and redemption process doesn’t pass through capital gains to shareholders. DFA is still primarily a mutual fund company though, in recent years, has been issuing ETFs and converting some mutual funds to ETFs. Avantis is a unit of American Century Investments.
DFA was founded on academic research such as that by Eugene Fama and Ken French showing that small cap and value stocks have higher expected returns than the market overall. Often lost in this message is that it was compensation for taking on more risk rather than a free lunch. That risk has played out over the past decade as small cap value stocks have significantly underperformed.
Avantis's ""Profitability"" Factor
Avantis adds in an additional factor they call profitability. It defines profitability as ongoing cash flow from operations. So, for example, if a company had a one-time event increasing free cash flow, that would be excluded. Avantis also adjusts book value to exclude goodwill and  also excludes REITs and utilities for the value funds. Research by Sunil Wahal, a consultant to Avantis and finance professor at Arizona State University, shows that companies with high profitability have outperformed similar value companies with low profitability between the years 1973 and 2023. Below is an illustration of their results.
That, of course, is back testing which typically fails going forward. How has it worked since Avantis launched? The Avantis US Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV) is the largest Avantis fund with about $10.5 billion in assets. Between 2020 and April 19, 2024, AVUV gained 73.9%. The DFA US Small Cap Value mutual fund (DFSVX) gained 60.4%, according to Morningstar. Though DFA launched the Dimensional US Small Cap Value ETF (DFSV) in 2022, I’m comparing to the mutual fund since it has a longer history. Still, a few years is not enough history to reach any statistical conclusion.
Morningstar analyst, Ryan Jackson, told me “Avantis is definitely cut from a similar cloth as Dimensional. Not only did its founder start there, but the lineup of products is quite similar—systematic, broadly diversified strategies that tend to lean toward smaller, cheaper, and higher-quality companies. Most of their funds are well constructed and managed with an eye toward reducing trading costs.”
Avantis's Repetto on Low Costs
I spoke with Eduardo Repetto, chief investment officer of Avantis. Repetto had been the co-CEO at DFA. I was curious as to why he chose American Century to launch his funds as it’s not known for having ultra-low-cost funds. He explained his funds had to have very low costs so launching a new stand-alone fund family would be too expensive for the investor. He knew the senior leadership team at American Century and they reached out to him. They needed a new brand of low-cost, academically-based funds and they already had the infrastructure in place so the incremental costs would be low, allowing for low costs to investors.
I asked Repetto whether their data showing past performance could merely be data-mining. He adamantly said no, stating he first started with a fundamental definition of a stock’s fair price and then tested that definition to see if it produced higher returns. As compelling as that argument is, every one of the hundreds of factors discovered started with a theory but the vast majority didn’t work going forward.
Repetto told me he believes in market efficiency to a degree but not in a strong-form sense. Strong-form means beating the market can only be attributed to luck. He did tell me he believes in William Sharpe’s Arithmetic of Active Investing that demonstrated some money must underperform the market if some outperforms. Avantis sent me a report claiming that, as of March 31 their funds have bested their benchmarks by an average of 1.80 percentage points annually over the past three years.
He said he expected Avantis to continue to outperform the market. I asked him point blank what he thought the probability is over the next decade of his small value fund outperforming DFA’s. Repetto responded that he “felt confident his fund would outperform the majority of small cap value funds that exist today.”
Wrapping it Up
Since 2020, Morningstar shows DFA has had $85.4 billion of outflows in their mutual funds and $72.4 billion inflows to their ETFs. DFA, founded 42 years ago, still has well over ten times the assets of Avantis. And while Avantis has gained $35.6 billion in new assets over the same time, American Century lost about $17 billion.
I think Avantis and DFA are great fund families and worthy of the three 2024 ETF.com awards they received. In my mind, it has never been about index vs. active and I do view any fund other than a total stock index fund as active. It’s about low cost diversified vs. high cost concentrated investing.
Will Avantis best DFA in performance? Will either best a plain old cap weighted total stock index fund? I know that I don’t know. But I do know that being consistent is important – don’t keep switching based on recent performance.
I also know that ETFs have far more tax efficiency than mutual fund wrappers. I applaud both Avantis and DFA for introducing their funds in ETF wrappers.

JEPI,2024-04-26,Long and the Short: ETFs for an Undecided Market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/long-short-etfs-undecided-market-120000314.html,"When investors hear the term “portfolio hedging,” their reactions may range from “why bother, the market goes up over time,” to “that’s too complicated, and hedge fund managers have had mixed results and mixed reputations over the years.”
I’m dismissing both of those responses to highlight an emerging segment of the ETF arsenal. It's one I used as an investment advisor for years until I ultimately pivoted to being the “hedged” manager for clients.
Way back then, I used mutual funds to design the hedged portfolios, assembling a group of funds with styles including long-short, which typically implies that the manager, in this case an ETF manager, is taking a position that is either leaning toward the “long” side of the market (if stocks go up, they expect to benefit) or the “short” side (if the market falls, they tend to do better).
Advisors have an increasing number of choices in this area, and I suspect more are coming as active ETFs inflows continue their rapid pace. Here are a few examples that advisors can use to start to research how they can essentially create their own “hedge fund of funds,” but with two key advantages over hedge funds.
Hedge Fund of Funds
First, the cost to the client is bound to be lower, and second, the advisor is in the allocator’s seat, and can make changes to the manager-of-managers portfolio as easily as selling an ETF to raise cash for a client that needs that cash in two days (trade settlement period).
The clear fund flow leader among long-short ETFs in 2024 has been the First Trust Long/Short Equity ETF (FTLS). It has added $230 million this year. That, and its 18.2% trailing 12-month return have pushed its assets under management to over $1 billion. That’s more than double what the ETF manager had to work with just two years ago.
This is a sign that the long-short approach is gaining some traction among ETF investors and advisors. However, when we consider the buying frenzy the past few years over covered call ETFs like the $33 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), which some would consider a competing ETF style to long-short, that indicates that long-short may just be starting to find its groove.
The Simplify Market Neutral Equity Long/Short ETF (EQLS) is a much smaller fund at $162 million in assets, and represents what was a very sought after investment style back in the day, via mutual funds. Market neutral funds go long and short but tend to gravitate toward equal exposure to each side of the coin. That essentially negates most market impacts and puts the onus of performance generation directly on the specific holdings of the ETF. It also is expected to keep volatility very low, often bond-like. So as with long-short, market neutral ETFs offer advisors a way to be invested, but always hedged in some fashion.

JEPI,2024-04-22,Actively Managed ETFs What Investors Need to Know,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/actively-managed-etfs-investors-know-153000144.html,"Actively managed ETFs are booming as total assets under management, now over $600 billion, have nearly doubled in the last two years.
In this deep-dive article, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of active ETFs, compare them to passively managed ETFs, explain what’s behind their recent growth, and we include a list of the top active ETFs as measured by AUM.
What Is an Actively Managed ETF?
An actively managed ETF is an exchange-traded fund that is managed by a portfolio manager or a team of managers who actively make investment decisions to try to outperform a specific benchmark or achieve a particular investment objective. This is in contrast to a passively managed ETF, which tracks a specific index and does not make any active trading decisions.
The largest active management ETF is the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) with $32 billion in assets, as of April 19, 2024. The 10 top active ETFs include a balance of equity funds and fixed income fund.
Actively Managed ETFs vs. Passively Managed ETFs
There are multiple differences between actively managed ETFs and passively managed ETFs, including the management style or investment strategy, potential for returns, fees and manager risk.
Investment Strategy
Actively managed ETFs are actively managed by a professional investment manager who makes decisions about which securities to include in the ETF's portfolio.
Passively managed ETFs track a specific index and do not make any active trading decisions.
Fees
Actively managed ETFs typically have higher fees because of the time and resources required for the manager and research team to actively seek and identify securities to hold in the portfolio. Higher frequency of trading can also increase costs.
Passively managed ETFs require few resources to manage and operate because these funds passively track the performance of an existing index of securities.
Potential for Returns
Actively managed ETFs have the potential to outperform the market if the investment manager makes better investment decisions than the market. However, there is no guarantee of outperformance.
Passively managed ETFs are designed to track the performance of the market, so they do not have the potential to outperform the market.
Manager Risk
Actively managed ETFs can be riskier than passively managed ETFs because the investment manager is making active trading decisions. These decisions can lead to losses if the market moves against the manager's predictions.
Passively managed ETFs are less risky because they are not making any active trading decisions.

JEPI,2024-04-18,Active ETFs Gain Appeal Amid Volatility,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/active-etfs-gain-appeal-amid-210859138.html,"As the bull market for stocks starts looking long in the tooth, and inflation, interest rates and growing geopolitical unrest boost market volatility, investors and financial advisors are leaning more heavily on actively managed ETFs in typical late-cycle fashion.
During the year's first three months, $60 billion, or 30%, of all ETF flows went into actively managed exchange-traded funds, according to a recent Fidelity Investments report. Active ETFs punched above their weight class, since they account for just 7% of total ETF assets.
“One of last year’s burgeoning trends was the increasing prevalence of actively managed ETFs,” the report stated.
That trend carried into the first quarter of this year with active ETFs representing 90 of the 138 ETFs launched so far this year, according to Fidelity’s research.
Passive indexed strategies still dominate ETF flows, with $132 billion worth of net flows into indexed ETFs during the quarter.
Chris Shuba, chief executive and founder of Helios Quantitative Research in Granite City, Calif., said diversification is moving front and center with financial advisors, especially after the past few years of seeing a handful of stocks dominate many of the broad market indexes.
“I believe the Mag Seven, as a group, are a strong representation of innovation and potential in the technology and near-technology space,” he said. “I wouldn't argue to completely divest from the Mag Seven, but diversification could be very beneficial at this stage.”
Among the largest actively managed ETFs, the$32.6 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) brought in $1.64 billion during the quarter, according to etf.com data. The $11.9 billion JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) brought in $2.57 billion.
While the growing trend toward active management is a popular move when the broad markets start slipping, Fidelity’s research shows some investors are still following familiar patterns.
For example, of the roughly $200 billion of inflows into U.S. ETFs during the first three months of the year, more than half of those net flows went into U.S. equity funds.
Beneath the flows into indexes, the research shows technology-focused ETFs leading all sectors in terms of net flows at $9.5 billion, while utility sector ETFs led on the other end with $2.3 billion worth of net outflows.
John Khoury, senior wealth manager at Savvy Advisors in Boson, views the money in motion as a prudent strategy for avoiding letting portfolios become too “top heavy.”
“It’s important to rebalance portfolios that have become over-exposed to stocks relative to bonds, cash, and alternative investments given the strong stock market performance over the last year,” he said. “Although bonds aren’t as exciting as stocks, they do offer attractive yields that can help reduce volatility and risk for an investor’s portfolio, especially for investors close to retirement or in-retirement.”

AKIKO FUJITA: According to our next guest, the ETF market is still going strong with $135 billion in new assets and about $200 billion in equities, with tech and growth dominating the sector. As part of the ETF Report brought to you by Invesco QQQ, let's bring in financial futurist David Nadig. David, it's good to talk to you today. So money is still flowing into ETFs. People aren't necessarily staying on the sidelines. Where's that going?
DAVE NADIG: Well, it's been an interesting year because we've had $1 trillion in money market mutual funds. That's been sort of this overhang of money on the sidelines, that classic phrase we always use. But inside the ETF market, what we've seen is a really strong bond market. We've seen huge flows into everything, from 30-year treasuries to CLOs and junk bonds. Almost throughout the spectrum, we've seen strong, strong flows. And at the same time, we've had about $200 billion in flows into equities, most of that in the US.
A lot of that is chasing the sort of indefatigable performance of the Magnificent Seven. It's been really hard to beat the S&P 500 again this year, up 15%, 16%. But despite that, we've seen a lot of flows into some more interesting pockets of the market. So it's a strong market. Investors are still participating. It's not going to be a record year in terms of ETF flows, but it's going to be close. And I think given what we've seen over the last two years, that's impressive by itself.
RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then, David, it's Rachelle here. Does it make sense that we're seeing these ETF flows into-- still into tech and growth, when a lot of people are sort of flooding into these safe havens, even if you look at gold's performance today? Help us make sense of why we're seeing this divergence.
DAVE NADIG: Well, some of it is that folks are really trapped in this risk-on, risk-off model, where they're trying to figure out whether they want to be aggressive and bet on this economy, staying strong, staying out of a real recession, or whether they're trying to be more defensive. And honestly, it's a bit of a barbell approach. Obviously, that money market money is very much in the risk-off camp. But meanwhile, when you look at where money is starting to get allocated inside the equity sleeve of ETFs, it's things like defensive income and small cap value.

PFF,2024-04-24,How to manage market volatility with ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/etf-exposures-protect-against-market-170945914.html,"With markets experiencing volatility stemming from geopolitical tensions and broad shifts in interest rate predictions, Bank of America Head of the Research Investment Committee Jared Woodard joins Wealth! to discuss the best ETF investment strategy for this environment.
Woodard highlights that ETFs are a valuable asset for investors who don't want to take a strong view ""on a particular slice of the market"" amid persistent market volatility. He notes that investors often opt for ETFs focused on specific sectors instead of individual equities to mitigate volatility. However, he emphasizes that in broader macroeconomic conditions, ETFs are utilized as a hedge against long-term volatility that may arise from factors such as inflation.
In the current higher for longer rate environment, Woodard advises investors to consider lending certain segments of the market, which ""can provide an income stream with less exposure"" to higher interest rates. Additionally, he recommends commodities such as gold futures (GC=F), stating that ""it's an incredibly important part of a portfolio.""

SKYY,2024-04-19,Thematic ETFs: Timing Is Everything,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thematic-etfs-timing-everything-120000560.html,"First it was clean energy then artificial intelligence. Thematic ETFs offer exposure to structural long-term megatrends.
However, timing the entry point is just as important as selecting the right theme.
BlackRock’s clean energy ETF provides a perfect example of this. While the iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) returned 17.6% annualized over the five years to the end of June 2023, the annualized return for investors—based on inflows and outflows—was -5.5%, a 23 percentage point gap, according to Morningstar research.
This is an extreme example given the thematic ETF poster child saw $5.8 billion in inflows between November 2020 and January 2021; however, it highlights the challenge of not only selecting the right ETF but also choosing when to invest.
“Investor buying and selling habits connected with thematic funds over the last five years have destroyed considerable value,” Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst at Morningstar, warned.
“Fund investors are collectively poor market-timers and they particularly struggle in more volatile and exotic funds compared with more diversified core building blocks,"" he said.
This is especially pronounced for thematic ETFs that have more concentrated portfolios. In the search to offer the purest exposure to a particular megatrend, ETF issuers move down the market-cap spectrum, potentially leading to greater volatility.
“ETFs’ concentration results in high levels of volatility,” Lamont added. “More volatile funds seem to induce more frequent trading and a tendency to buy high and sell low. Most investors would achieve better investment outcomes by adopting a more patient buy-and-hold approach.”
As a result, demand for thematic ETFs has waned, with some investors concerned about the volatility and overlap with traditional sectors.
According to data from ETFbook, thematic ETFs have seen $116 million in outflows so far in 2024, as of March 22, adding to the $1.1 billion in net redemptions last year.
This is in stark contrast to the combined $16.3 billion in inflows in 2021 and 2022 as investors embraced the digital shift following the COVID-19 pandemic. Assets in thematic ETFs currently total $44 billion, as at the end of 2023.
How thematic ETFs fit within a multi-asset portfolio is a challenge for fund selectors, with questions around whether they remain a satellite holding or can be incorporated as a core building block.
“Thematic ETFs will likely always be used as an extension to allocations in more traditional sectors, and normally only in higher risk portfolios, as opposed to being standalone allocations within our strategic asset allocation,” Terry McGivern, senior research analyst at AJ Bell, told ETF Stream.

TLTW,2024-09-04,BlackRock Bond ETFs Hit $1T Mark,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-bond-etfs-hit-1t-204606300.html,"BlackRocks’ iShares global fixed income ETF business has crested the $1 trillion mark, representing about 40% of the $2.5 trillion global bond ETF market, according to the company.
And that is just the beginning of a longer-term trend toward ramped-up flows into bond ETFs, according to Steve Laipply, BlackRock’s global co-head of fixed income ETFs.
Citing the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes during the early days of the Covid pandemic at a time when bond yields were much lower, Laipply told etf.com that “the hiking cycle kicked open the door for investors to take another look at fixed income.”
“Pre Covid, you had to go down in credit quality and down in liquidity to get decent yields,” he added.
Those higher rates drove many investors toward the comfort of money markets and short-term bond ETFs, but Laipply sees the Fed’s migration toward the start of a rate-cutting cycle as the next potential growth spurt for bond ETFs.
“You would have to go back to 2004 to see the yields you saw at the beginning of this year,” he said. “Going forward, once the Fed starts easing and the attractive yields (at the short end of the curve) start dropping, there will be another impetus for longer term yields.”
Laipply said asset flows into bond ETFs are already moving ahead of Fed policy because institutional investors and financial advisors recognize that “Fed policy is difficult to try and time.”
“What ultimately happens is the longer-term yields move in anticipation of Fed policy,” he said. “If you’re waiting for the all-clear signal, you might miss out.”
AGG, TLT Lead iShares to $1T
So far this year, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) is leading the inflows with $15 billion, followed by the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) with $10.8 billion worth of inflows.
etf.com
Beyond the immediate navigation of Fed policy, Laipply said fixed income ETFs are benefiting from a “sea change in the way investors view bond ETFs.”
He mentioned the spike in volatility during the early days of Covid at the start of 2020 as a “stress test for fixed income ETFs.”
As bond traders across the board scrambled for liquidity during that period, Laipply said, “investors really started gravitating toward bond ETFs, particularly institutional investors, and that has been intact since then.”
According to BlackRock, global bond ETF assets currently represent nearly 2% of the $140 trillion global bond market, and the forecast is for bond ETF assets to reach $6 trillion by 2030.
“Money is in motion because of the normalization of yields,” Laipply said. “And there are structural trends favoring fixed income ETFs, including model portfolios, fee-based advisors and institutional investors.”

USD,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

USD,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

USD,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

USD,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

USD,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

USD,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) – Average Daily Volume: 169.7 million shares

ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ provides three times inverse exposure to the daily performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, charging 95 bps in annual fees.

USD,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

USD,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

USD,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs.

If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

USD,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

USD,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

USD,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

Equity ETPs drove the bulk of the inflows, attracting $126.6 billion in July, their strongest month since December. Meanwhile, fixed income ETP flows reached an all-time high of $60.5 billion.
“In contrast to previous record fixed income (FI) flow months, which have often been driven by an increase in buying in one particular exposure, the pickup in global FI flows in July was broad-based,” BlackRock noted in the report.
SPY 1 Month Net Fund Flows
Rates, Credit Lead Fixed Income Surge
July’s fixed income inflows were diverse, unlike in previous record-setting months. Rates ETPs generated $19.8 billion in inflows, the most since October 2023. Investment grade credit flows hit $13.6 billion, their second-highest month ever.
High yield and emerging market debt remained positive, gathering $4 billion and $3.2 billion respectively. EMEA-listed fixed income ETPs notched their own monthly record, led by rates ($3.6 billion) and investment grade ($3.4 billion).
“It was a similar story in EMEA-listed FI ETPs, which also marked a new monthly flow record,” Karim Chedid, head of investment strategy for iShares EMEA at BlackRock, said.
Gold ETPs shined with $3.2 billion in inflows, the most since March 2022, while silver funds added $800 million. The precious metal flows were concentrated in U.S. listed products.
“July also marked the third consecutive month of inflows into gold ETPs and the biggest month for gold buying since March 2022, alongside net buying of silver ETPs,” Chedid noted
U.S. small-cap equity flows accelerated to $14.2 billion in July, second only to December 2023’s $16.2 billion. European small-caps cooled to just $100 million.
Among factors, quality led with $1.4 billion, though value was close behind at $1 billion. Quality flows dipped to their lowest levels since January.

U.S. equity flows slowed to $51.2 billion, but emerging market equities saw increased interest. The report noted “a marked increase in Mexico and India equity ETP buying post-election.” European equity flows held steady at $2.5 billion.
In the EMEA-listed segment, emerging market preferences were clear: “India led, with $0.7B of inflows, while $0.4B was added to Mexico ETPs – the highest monthly inflows for EMEA-listed Mexico ETPs on record,"" the report said.
U.S. Treasurys Surging
In the fixed income space, rates products led with $12.5 billion in inflows, the report stated. U.S. Treasury ETFs continued to grow, through European rates products also saw continued buying.
“The vast majority of European rates buying went into blended maturity exposures, while UST ETP flows showed more of a preference for targeted duration exposure,” the report said.
Investment grade credit flows rose to their highest level since January at $7.8 billion, helping to offset flat high yield flows. Notably, “Eurozone IG flows rose to the highest level since February, at $1.4B, while US IG flows rose to $5.4B.”
Emerging market debt ETFs recorded their third straight month of inflows, adding $1.6 billion in June.
Gold ETPs experienced a second consecutive month of inflows for the first time in a year, attracting $1.3 billion. The report highlighted that these inflows “went entirely into EMEA-listed ETPs, with APAC-listed inflows and US-listed outflows netting out over the month.”
Investors showed renewed interest in silver ETFs, which had $300 million in inflows following two months of outflows totaling $1 billion, according to the report.

VWO,2024-04-23,Investors Love This Under the Radar Emerging Markets ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-love-under-radar-emerging-120000279.html,"The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF (EMXC) has quietly become one of the largest emerging markets exchange-traded funds.
This year, investors have pushed $3.8 billion into the ETF, the largest inflows for any emerging markets ETF by far.
That’s taken the fund’s assets under management to $12.5 billion, making it the fourth-largest U.S.-listed EM exchange-traded fund after the $74 billion iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG), the $73.7 billion Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) and the $16.6 billion iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM).
EMXC’s growth suggests that investors are interested in putting money to work in emerging markets stocks, but they don’t want to deal with the risks of China.
EMXC tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets ex China Index, giving it a much different look than broader EM funds like IEMG and VWO.
For instance, IEMG has 23% of its portfolio allocated to China, while EMXC has no positions in Chinese stocks.
Instead, EMXC’s largest geography is India, with a 25% weighting, followed by Taiwan, with 23%, and Korea, with 16%.
For IEMG, India, Taiwan and Korea have smaller weightings of 19%, 18%, and 22%, respectively.
EMXC Growing as China Faces Economic Downturn
EMXC’s growing popularity reflects the angst investors have about China. Once a darling among investors, China is now grappling with an economic downturn, a declining population, and geopolitical tensions with the West.
A perception that the Chinese government is more hostile to big businesses has also weighed on sentiment.
There is the possibility that investors are abandoning China at precisely the wrong moment.  With sentiment so negative, perhaps Chinese stocks are at or close to their lows.
Only time will tell.
But even if that’s the case, investors need to be able to sleep comfortably. And if buying emerging markets without exposure to China helps them do that, then there’s nothing wrong with that.

XLK,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

The firm projects that the market for AI-related hardware and software could expand by 40-50% annually, reaching approximately $990 billion by 2027.
Bain & Company global technology and cloud services practice chairman David Crawford joins Market Domination to dig into the bullish projection and discuss the outlook for AI as it seeps into all corners of the market.
Crawford sees three ""broad pockets of growth"" for AI. First, large hyperscalers building out their capabilities are generating ""enormous"" demand. This demand, he says, ""works its way back through the supply chain and creates shortages in a spectrum of spaces.""
The second pocket for growth lies in enterprise adoption. Crawford explains, ""We know the trends are smaller models, more specialized models, open source, etc., but likewise requires computational capability. In some cases, they're using special-purpose compute and so forth.""

Finally, the third area for growth will likely be seen in independent software vendors that build AI capabilities for their products and run them in their own data centers.
As generative AI becomes more widely adopted, Crawford believes there will be increased interest in sovereign ownership, control, and domiciled data centers. He tells Yahoo Finance, ""It's broadly perceived that AI will be quite different and that it'll control culture, access to health and welfare, things like that. And so we think that the sort of state interests will play a much bigger role in the ultimate location of where all this occurs.""

XLK,2024-09-20,Analyst outlines best options market plays post-triple witching,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/analyst-outlines-best-options-market-215317999.html,"Friday’s market close marked the end of a “triple witching” session where $5.1 trillion in stock index futures, stock index options, and stock options expire simultaneously. September’s triple witching comes the same week as the Federal Reserve kicks off its rate-cutting cycle and a rebalancing of the S&P 500 (^GSPC).
eToro US investment and options analyst Bret Kenwell joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the options playbook after the big day for options traders.
“Today was one of the four big expiration dates of the year when it comes to the options market, and you saw that action leading up to today's session with so much back and forth,"" Kenwell tells Yahoo Finance.
“We had a late day pop in stocks, and a lot of that plays into the expiration, but I think what's really interesting is when you look at the seasonality in September, it tends to be pretty bad for US stocks, and when you really dial into that seasonality, you see a lot of it comes in the so-called back half of mid-month…so that leaves the door open at least to see some choppiness, some profit taking, or some outright seasonal weakness kind of going into the end of the quarter.”

Kenwell says he’s expecting strength in the tech sector after “tech has sort of fallen by the wayside amid all this, you know, breadth expansion...suddenly it's gone from the favorite stocks, the leadership group to being, I think it's the fourth or fifth best performer of the year.”
Kenwell says there were “a lot of put sales into some of the Magnificent Seven names or a lot of the semiconductor leaders” during downturns earlier in the month. He adds “I don't know that that's necessarily the best way for a retail investor to play. It's probably a more reasonable way to play at this point would be by either buying calls or if they wanted to reduce that cost and limit their upside a bit. Call spread would be a great way to get into it.”

As mega-cap tech stocks gain and September's interest rate cut sends the market higher (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC), Orton says he still likes the Big Tech sector.
“There's plenty of reasons that clients still want to own the mega-cap technology names. Especially the high-quality ones that are generating $50 [billion], $60 [billion], $70 billion of free cash flow per year. But what I've been encouraging clients really for the past three months or so is that we have an opportunity to build better balance in our portfolios.”
“Now that we're finally starting to get rate cuts, I think we're starting to see more of a clear path to get to that soft landing. That should support a lot more cyclical parts of the market, too, that maybe haven't done as well as technology,"" he says about the Federal Reserve's rate cut move.

Orton explains that there are stocks and sectors he sees benefiting from the AI boom without being directly tied to developing the tech the way Big Tech companies are, what he calls the “AI 2.0 bucket.""
“Take the industrial space, for example. You look at electric equipment companies. We know we need more power in this country. We also know we need to cool data centers down as you continue to get more of them. So companies that are producing cooling solutions and liquid cooling, those names look very attractive.”
Orton says he tells clients to “play offense with defense” as while there are concerns around geopolitical conflict, defense companies are benefiting from governments' increased spending. “You're finally seeing that translate into increased earnings and free cash flow across a number of defense companies.”
“There's an opportunity in that part of the market and in totally non-related to artificial intelligence,” that “aren't just tech or semiconductors,” Orton tells Yahoo Finance.

Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss how to play the tech sector.
“It's a buy the news, sell the news reaction to the Fed,” Chronert says. “The leadership this quarter has really been those areas of the market that are perceived beneficiaries of lower rates. So real estate, utilities, even the homebuilder ETFs have been hitting recent highs. In the meantime, tech is still lagging where it was last time the index was through 5,600.""
“Essentially what you have here… is that a bit of a profit taking on the news in those areas that have been perceived as rate sensitive. And, at the same time, a catch-up move in that mega-cap growth cohort that ultimately does benefit from lower interest rates, but has been a relative laggard thus far this quarter. All told, what you've got is an index moving higher.”

Taking a look at the Magnificent 7, Chronert outlines Citi’s view on the group: “We've been arguing for the better part of this year that they're becoming more idiosyncratic in their behavior.”
He explains that Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) — who control over 6% of the index — ""those companies are going to be important to index price action and I think you're seeing that today. But, what we're focused on from this barbell angle is we want to be holders of those, but when you look at the rate of increase in this and forward-year earnings expectations, it's been a stair-step function for over a year now.

""We have seen Nvidia (NVDA) come into some troubles recently, but I think you have to keep that in perspective that the stock is still up over 100% year to date,"" Kinahan says.
""Overall, I think it's really, sort of shortsighted to say that technology will not continue to lead us,"" Kinahan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that monetizing artificial intelligence (AI) spending will be ""key"" to a continued tech rally.
Kinahan indicates that Nvidia remains a top name among Tastytrade's retail clients. Alongside Nvidia, he highlights that clients also seem bullish on Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and the United Parcel Service (UPS) while there was broad bearishness around Lululemon (LULU), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Disney (DIS).

XLK,2024-09-10,State Street Unveils Galaxy-Managed Digital Asset ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-unveils-galaxy-managed-202809948.html,"State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) has introduced three actively managed ETFs focused on digital assets and disruptive technologies, sub-advised by Galaxy Asset Management.
The new offerings will target companies involved in blockchain, cryptocurrency and other emerging technologies, according to a press release announcing the funds.
“Digital assets and blockchain technology have the power to transform financial markets as well as the economy over the next decade, and a number of companies will grow and flourish thanks to their contribution to this transformative technology,” said Anna Paglia, SSGA chief business officer, said in the release.
The ETFs debut as issuers try to address strong demand for crypto-focused investment products following the success of spot bitcoin ETFs, which have generated nearly $17 billion in inflows since they started trading in January.
The SPDR Galaxy Digital Asset Ecosystem ETF (DECO) focuses on companies benefiting from blockchain and digital asset adoption, including cryptocurrency exposures through ETFs and futures, according to Matt Bartolini, head of Americas research at SPDR.
“DECO is going to try to hold the whole entire ecosystem of companies that Galaxy deems to be on the leading edge of the digital asset ecosystem for some of that long-term capital appreciation,” Bartolini told etf.com in an interview.
The SPDR Galaxy Hedged Digital Asset Ecosystem ETF (HECO) offers similar exposure but incorporates an options overlay to manage volatility, Bartolini said.
Meanwhile, SPDR Galaxy Transformative Tech Accelerators ETF (TEKX) targets the “infrastructure, the backbone of what makes up those digital asset technologies,” Bartolini said.
Digital Asset Innovation
The partnership combines State Street’s ETF expertise with Galaxy’s digital asset knowledge, Bartolini said.
“Galaxy, they're a global leader in digital assets,” Bartolini said. ""They have a diversified business across different digital asset industries, whether it's within blockchain, offering institutional grade financial services, developing blockchain infrastructure, mining, you name it. I think they've been one of the leaders in the overall global digital economy.”
Bartolini cautioned that the nascent industry remains volatile and that ETFs will be concentrated in single stocks and specific industries, leading to idiosyncratic risks.
HECO aims to manage some of this volatility for clients seeking digital asset exposure with potentially less risk than DECO’s pure approach, Bartolini added.

XLV,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

XLV,2024-10-01,Here's how AI is set to disrupt healthcare — albeit slowly,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
The third quarter just wrapped, and the pure AI trade of Nvidia (NVDA) and its chip cohorts suddenly finds itself a net drag on overall S&P 500 performance — which itself surprised investors with a solid 5.5% return.
Nevertheless, generative AI is still hot and slowly moving into real-world applications.
Abby Yoder, US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, highlighted that healthcare, which is notoriously slow-moving, may be an upcoming candidate for AI-driven innovation.
""Healthcare has underperformed seven of the last eight years,"" Yoder pointed out in a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, despite the sector being the only one in the S&P 500 to boast positive annual earnings growth over the past 21 years.
But Yoder sees AI as a potential key to unlock a long-awaited shake-up that could bring long-term growth back to the sector.
Healthcare stocks have struggled in recent years, a trend Yoder attributes to legacy constraints of old systems and obstacles that make it difficult for new technologies to take root. The byzantine web of players, rules, regulators, and more has so far prevented significant AI adoption, which has the potential to address inefficiencies in insurance approvals, manual record-keeping, and claims management, all of which drag on productivity.

There are some ripples of change, however. Companies like Google and Microsoft are diving into this space, partnering with hospitals and startups to create AI tools that lighten this burden.
On the diagnostic side, AI is being used to streamline medical imaging, cutting down time for tasks like identifying patterns in medical data, which improves both speed and accuracy in patient care. The goal is not to rid the world of human radiologists and technicians, but empower them with 21st-century tools that lighten their load and accelerate patient diagnoses and recoveries.
AI proponents say it's not just about cutting costs; it’s about revolutionizing patient care. By using vast datasets of clinical information, the promise of AI is to someday help predict patient outcomes more effectively, modeling care before it happens to anticipate complications and select treatments.
The other great hope for medical AI bulls is the immense promise for drug discovery.
According to Morgan Stanley's healthcare forecast, the company's head of US biopharma research Terence Flynn estimates that “[every] 2.5% improvement in preclinical development success rates could lead to an additional 30-plus new drug approvals over 10 years,"" which would represent around $70 billion.

XLV,2024-09-16,"Fed eyes interest rate cut, TikTok heads to court: Catalysts",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/fed-eyes-interest-rate-cut-180254569.html,"On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down key stories from how an interest rate cut and the election may impact markets to TikTok's legal battle against a potential ban in the US.
While tech has certainly spearheaded the market's record growth this year, many investors are gearing up for a potential rotation as interest rates ease. HSBC head of equity strategy for the Americas Nicole Inui explains that the market will likely broaden outside of tech, benefiting sectors like financials (XLF), utilities (XLU), and healthcare (XLV). She adds, ""When we look at the market as a whole, it looks like it's trading at a very hefty premium. You take out the Mag Seven, you take out tech, valuations aren't as elevated compared to historical levels. So yes, tech, Mag Seven, you still see strong earnings growth.""
EY chief economist Greg Daco expects the Federal Reserve to initiate a 25-basis-point cut as it kicks off its rate-easing cycle. However, he notes that the central bank walks a delicate tightrope: ""If you ease monetary policy by 25 basis points, it does little to nothing in terms of consumer rates, auto loan rates, mortgage rates, very little. But the risks are asymmetric. If the Fed does not ease monetary policy by as much as markets are anticipating, then you'll actually see a repricing of rates and you're going to see upward movement in terms of rates, and that could damage consumer spending activity, housing activity, business investment. That is the real risk right now.""

Meanwhile, TikTok is in court on Monday for a key hearing in its ongoing battle to block a law that could ban the app in the US. Rachel Tipograph, the CEO of e-commerce analytics company MikMak, tells Yahoo Finance that the odds of a TikTok disruption, either through a ban or a sale, are rising. Looking at Snapchat (SNAP) and Meta Platforms (META) stock, the analyst says, “There is an implied probability there that TikTok disruption is more likely than not in the next four months, and I feel that could manifest into either a complete sale, complete ban, or somewhere in between.” He says this means “eyeballs and money move away from TikTok” which helps Meta and Snapchat.
GenWealth Financial Advisors financial advisor and host of ""Get Ready for the Future Show"" Scott Inman joins Catalysts to discuss how the election may impact markets (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) and how investors can best prepare their portfolios for the rest of the year. He believes that markets ""don't really care about who is in office,"" noting that they have performed well and GDP (gross domestic product) has grown regardless of a Democratic or Republican administration.

Traders have been pricing in a 25-basis-point interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its September meeting next week. Crescent Grove Advisors co-chief investment officer Andrew Krei notes that the labor market has been increasingly in focus since July's jobs report saw the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, sparking fears of a recession. However, he believes that the labor market data shows the economy ""softening off of an ultra-hot level"" rather than indicating the beginnings of a recession.
According to new data from Fidelity, there are now almost half a million 401(k) plan participants with balances of at least $1 million in their accounts. UBS financial advisor Tracy Byrnes encourages retirement savers to not ""set it and forget it,"" and explains the importance of revisiting a retirement account to rebalance and diversify. She warns, ""What was good when you started working 20 years ago might not still work today.""

The latest Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey shows Americans are still under pressure from high prices, as necessities like food are straining budgets and wallets. Former USDA economist and Cal Poly professor of agribusiness Richard Volpe explains that in 2021 and 2022, ""we saw food prices increase at a clip that we hadn't seen in the US since the 1970s."" He notes that while inflation has cooled across the board, food prices have not fallen.
As the holidays are right around the corner, retail sales are likely to increase between 2.3% and 3.3% from 2023, according to Deloitte's annual holiday retail forecast. Deloitte Consulting retail and consumer products leader Michael Jeschke believes that retailers with omnichannel approaches will likely outperform this holiday season, expecting a 7% to 9% acceleration as they ""are best able to meet consumers where they are.""

""We're coming off the back end of a pretty long inflation battle here with rates being at historic peaks. And, you know, you look at the underlying macro data that we're staring at every day, and it's not exceptional, but it's not bad either. It's just kind of in this middling phase. And certainly a much better start to this week than we had last week,"" McGrath explains.
He argues that the Fed's cuts will not immediately come to the rescue as its cuts will likely ""take time to work through."" He adds, ""I don't think you have to look much further than a lot of the numbers we've seen from the consumer discretionary companies, where they're slashing forecast because the demand just isn't there like it has been.

While inflation is down, he argues, ""the problem is there's 20 to 30% built up in there that's still increasing on a month-over-month basis. And it's just the consumer's got to get tapped out at some point. And I'm not saying that's like a death and destruction phase coming, but you are starting to see inklings of that."" However, easing rates should help counter that issue.
Moving forward, McGrath believes the equities market ""could be a bit rocky,"" so investors should take more of a defensive approach and take a position in sectors like industrials (XLI), utilities (XLU), healthcare (XLV), real estate (XLRE), and consumer staples (XLP). He also recommends semiconductors, calling them ""the new industrial."" On the fixed-income side, he argues that ""it's probably time to start taking some duration there"" as the Fed kicks off its rate easing cycle.

XLV,2024-07-20,XLV ETF: Healthcare Sector Offers Plenty of Bargains,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xlv-etf-healthcare-sector-offers-054907592.html,"The Healthcare sector offers plenty of bargains, with a surprising number of the prominent healthcare stocks held by the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) trading at low prices.
Against a market backdrop where Technology sector stocks have racked up huge gains over the past year-plus, a sector like Healthcare looks like an attractive place for investors to allocate some of their profits if the market rotates and the rally expands beyond big tech.
I’m bullish on XLV based on the inexpensive valuations of the blue-chip Healthcare stocks it holds, as well as the favorable ratings these holdings and the ETF itself receive from TipRanks’ Smart Score system. Plus, XLV is a sensible holding, thanks to its cost-effective expense ratio.
What Is the XLV ETF’s Strategy? 
The XLV ETF invests in the stocks that comprise the healthcare sector of the S&P 500 (SPX). This is a broad range of stocks that can include companies in the “pharmaceuticals; health care equipment and supplies; health care providers and services; biotechnology; life sciences tools and services; and health care technology industries.”
The fund dates back all the way to 1998 and has $40 billion in assets under management (AUM).
I like the Healthcare sector because its stocks are often defensive and countercyclical. They often feature steady, stable revenue and earnings streams and are less tied to the state of the broader economy than many other stocks. People still need the same medicines, treatments, and medical procedures, whether the economy is doing well or not.
I also like that the sector features quite a few stocks with very appealing valuations, not to mention attractive dividend yields, as we’ll discuss more in-depth in the next section.
If investors rotate out of stocks from sectors where stocks typically have higher valuation multiples, like Technology, then the lower valuations and high yields offered up by Healthcare stocks could make the sector an attractive place for these investors to park some of their gains.
We may already be seeing the beginnings of this dynamic coming into play, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NDX) is down 4% over the past week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which skews more towards traditional, old economy stocks, is up 0.7% over the same time frame.
This isn’t to say that the tech bull market is over or that it’s time to exit tech trades. However, it illustrates that there are plenty of other sectors of the market that look primed to join in the rally.
A Value Investor’s Paradise
XLV invests in 64 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 56.8% of the fund. Below, you can check out an overview of XLV’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.

Former President Donald Trump has picked Senator JD Vance (R-Oh.) as his 2024 running mate. Axios chief economics correspondent Neil Irwin explains that while Trump likes to tout populist ideas on the campaign trail, he has had a different view in the White House. While Vance has his own ideas, it is unknown if his sentiments will translate into policy in his vice president role. He says, ""[Trump] also loves talking to CEOs and loves talking about how he's so great for business. He just floated cutting the corporate income tax rate again. He cut it from 38% to 21% when he was in office, he wants to go down to 15% now, he says. So look, there's a lot of things Trump would like to do that are certainly business priorities and things that big business would like to see. And Vance as vice president would just be one voice at the table, kind of trying to shape those policies.""

Healthcare stocks spiked in 2020, surpassing returns in the broader market as the pandemic took hold. But the sector experienced a tumultuous year in 2023, when a ""COVID-19 hangover"" caused the stocks to decline as some companies saw demand normalize.
The sector has followed an upward trajectory in 2024, though it hasn't kept pace with other sectors, such as Technology (XLK) or Communication Services (XLC). On Wednesday, the Health Care Select ETF reached a record-high close, though it fell more than 2% during Thursday's session.
Eye expects the sector to see more upside partially due to its valuation. He noted the healthcare sector is reasonably valued relative to the overall market and trades at a discount to the S&P 500.
Eye also described demographic trends, such as the increase in the population over the age of 65 and rising healthcare spending, as establishing a foundation for sector growth.
""Those demographics are extremely favorable for the healthcare sector,"" Eye said. ""We think that just creates a very strong fundamental backdrop for a lot of pharmaceutical companies as well as healthcare insurance.""
Medical breakthroughs are also increasing in prominence. 2023 saw the second-highest number of FDA novel drug approvals in the last 30 years. Innovation could offer another tailwind for the sector, given the the rise of AI and the buzz around GLP-1 drugs.

Some industries and specific stocks in healthcare have seen outsized growth. Drug manufacturer companies, which account for about 35% of the healthcare sector, have seen shares rise 13% year to date. And Eli Lilly has been at the head of the pharmaceutical charge due to its GLP-1 development and FDA approval of its Alzheimer's drug. Lilly has a 45% year-to-date return.

XLV,2024-05-13,One stock is dragging down the S&P 500's earnings growth,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-stock-is-dragging-down-the-sp-500s-earnings-growth-164113227.html,"Companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have reported what's broadly been considered a solid Q1 earnings season for the index, with one key exception: drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY).
Last month, the company reported a massive loss per share in the first quarter on charges related to a series of acquisitions and cut its profit forecast for the year.
With 92% of S&P companies done reporting, the index is pacing for 5.4% earnings growth compared to the year-ago quarter, which would be the largest year-over-year earnings growth for the index since the second quarter of 2022. Take out Bristol, and the pace jumps to 8.3%, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters.
Overall, the Health Care sector (XLV) has seen earnings decline by 25.4% from the same quarter a year ago, in line with Energy's (XLE) decline for the worst performance in the S&P 500 this quarter.
When removing a few other companies from the sector, the S&P 500's earnings growth would shoot even higher. Butters also ran the numbers for the index when excluding Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Gilead Sciences reported a loss per share of $1.32 in the most recent quarter, compared to earnings per share of $1.37 in the same quarter a year ago. Pfizer meanwhile reported earnings per share of $0.82, down from $1.23 in the same quarter a year ago.
When removing those two companies and Bristol Myers Squibb, the S&P 500 would be pacing for earnings growth of 9.7%, per Butters' analysis.
Interestingly, declining earnings haven't weighed on the overall sector performance in the last month. The Health Care sector has been up a modest 1.4% in the past month, the fourth-best performance of any sector and better than the S&P 500's 1.2% return during the time period.
This comes as the earnings declines aren't expected to continue in the sector. After Bristol Myers Squibb reported its massive loss attributed to its acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics, analysts expect the company to bounce back in the second quarter with earnings per share of $1.69, down from $1.75 in the year-earlier period.
Earnings in the sector overall are expected to rebound in the second quarter too. Data from FactSet shows Health Care is expected to produce the second-highest year-over-year growth of any sector in the second quarter, with Wall Street consensus projecting 17.2%
FundStrat head of research Tom Lee wrote in a note to clients on May 10 that rebounds currently expected in Health Care, Energy, and Materials (XLB) are ""a tailwind for stocks.""

XLV,2024-04-29,10 Best ETFs for Stagflation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-etfs-stagflation-120000260.html,"First-quarter growth fell more than expected, rising at an annualized rate of 1.6%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s a slower growth rate than the forecast of 2.5%, and much lower than the 3.4% increase achieved in the fourth quarter.
Combine that with three months of inflation reports above consensus estimates, and you get two of the key ingredients of stagflation.
Fortunately, there are some exchange-traded funds that may offer potential hedges or opportunities during stagflation.
In this article, we provide insight into how to navigate this environment with what have traditionally been considered the best ETFs for stagflation.
What Is Stagflation?
Stagflation is an economic environment that combines stagnant economic growth with high inflation. Imagine an economy stuck in neutral, where prices for goods and services are high and rising but businesses aren't expanding, and unemployment remains stubbornly high. This creates a double whammy for consumers, as their purchasing power shrinks while job opportunities dwindle.
In 2024, the only missing ingredient for full on stagflation is high unemployment, but investors are wise to educate themselves on the best types of investments to buy and hold in this challenging environment.
What Are the Best ETFs for Stagflation?
There isn't a guaranteed perfect ETF for stagflation, because stagflation is a complex economic condition with a combination of high inflation and stagnant economic growth. However, there are some types of ETFs that might perform better than others during stagflation. Here are a few to consider:
Commodity ETFs
During stagflation, commodities may perform well as they tend to retain value during periods of high inflation. Consider ETFs that track the prices of commodities such as gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products. Examples include:
SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)
iShares Silver Trust (SLV)
United States Oil Fund (USO)
Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA)
Short-Term Treasury Bond ETFs
Short-term treasury ETFs can provide relative safety and liquidity during stagflation. While they may not offer high returns, they can help preserve capital in uncertain economic environments by providing high relative yields with low interest-rate sensitivity. Examples include:
iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV)
Vanguard Short-Term Government Bond ETF (VGSH)
iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV)
Defensive Sector ETFs
Defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities are generally considered good investments for stagflation. These sectors provide essential goods and services that people need regardless of economic conditions. Even during periods of high inflation and stagnant growth, people will still need electricity, healthcare, and basic consumer products. Examples include:

RACHELLE AKUFFO: According to S&P Global Market Research, investor risk appetite appears to be improving in February as markets digest better growth prospects in the US economy and easing recession risks. Now, leading the way are health care and tech sectors. The latest innovations in obesity drugs with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly's GLP-1s fueling the health care sector rally so far this year. So what are the best ways to invest in health care and weight loss-related stocks using ETFs?
Well, as part of our ETF Report, brought to you by Invesco QQQ, let's bring in our next guest, Yuri Khodjamirian, Tema ETFs Chief Investment Officer, to discuss more. Thank you for joining us this morning. So I want to first start with the latest here, which was the FDA's approval of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy to treat heart disease. So another one of these additional benefits of this weight loss drug that actually was started off as a diabetes drug here. What does this open up then in how people can invest in this space?
YURI KHODJAMIRIAN: Yeah, I mean, look, it's great to see the FDA approve it off the back of essentially data that Novo Nordisk delivered back in the summer and then the full data readout in November, December last year. This was a major trial. They took 17,000 patients, five years. And what they showed was a 20% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events. So for the first time, we're starting to see real evidence that weight loss drugs actually benefit patients. And this is going to be a big deal in terms of payers.

What we're reading
Economic data releases and earnings
As the major indexes closed in the red on Wednesday, 43 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) still managed to hit all-time highs.
In fact, record highs are piling up in 2024, with a solid 26% of all S&P 500 components (126 total) hitting at least one all-time high this year.
Nvidia (NVDA) lives up to its hype and tops the S&P 500 in broken records — notching 23 record highs over 40 trading days this year. It's also at the top of the benchmark index when it comes to returns this year, up over 50%.
But setting aside the AI-inspired headlines, it's the Industrials sector that has the most all-time highs with nearly half of its components in the S&P 500 hitting records. It also happens to be the second-best-performing sector in February, up nearly 7%.
Industrial stalwarts like Waste Management (WM) and Caterpillar (CAT) might not have semiconductor cachet, but they do have nearly 30 record highs between them. Uber Technologies (UBER), which recently replaced JetBlue (JBLU) in the Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT), buoys the sector's totals as well with 13 record highs and a return north of 25% year to date.
The top sector by performance this month — consumer discretionary, up over 7% — represents a diverse set of industries with stocks at record highs. Restaurants like Chipotle (CMG) and McDonald's (MCD), homebuilders like Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI), and travel stocks like Hilton (HLT) and Booking (BKNG) all contribute to the 100-plus record highs in the sector this month.
Both the Financials and Health Care sectors each have more than one quarter of their components hitting records in 2024 and are posting the second- and third-best respective sector returns of the year. JPMorgan (JPM) has clocked a respectable eight record highs this year. But insurer Progressive (PGR) hit an overall third-best 21 record highs. Like many insurers, it was among the leaders breaking to new highs late last year.
Though megacap in its own right, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) doesn't get Magnificent Seven headlines. But the insurer sports a market cap over a fifth bigger than Tesla. Warren Buffett's famed conglomerate is up 15%, with 15 record highs this year.
In Health Care, Boston Scientific (BSX) comes in second-best to Nvidia overall with 22 record highs. The weight-loss craze is seeing Eli Lilly (LLY) up 30% this year with 16 record highs. Though this analysis surveys large-cap stocks as represented by the S&P 500, small- and mid-cap biotech stocks have also been breaking to the upside recently. See Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), which has tripled its price this month alone and hit nine record highs.

SEANA SMITH: All right. Well, we're nearly just about 35 minutes into the trading day. Major markets trading to the downside. We're still seeing some pressure here across the board. The NASDAQ leading the way lower. The biggest underperformer in today's early market action, off just about 1%. But is there some reason to be a bit optimistic. Jared Blikre is standing by at the big board for us to tell us more. Jared?
JARED BLIKRE: Seana, there is reason to be optimistic. And hold on a second here. I just want to point out my first point here is that February tends to be a down month for the markets, for stocks, in general, especially in this year of the presidential cycle. But that doesn't mean that we're looking to sell everything.
In fact, we've seen some weakness over the last five days in some of those market leaders. And we want to figure out what could be leading next. In other words, we have sector rotation going on. And we want to take a look at what is taking the place of these tech stocks.
This is a SPDR sector action over the last five days. Tech, by far, the worst of the sectors, then consumer discretionary and communication services. Not a coincidence that those are the megacap sectors.
And you take a look at what's happened in the chip space over the last five days. We have not seen a lot of bullish action here as well. So what has been working recently? We've seen a number of markets come to record highs only recently. And this is the five-day total.
I just want to start with the Nikkei 225. We'd have to look at a max chart here. This is only now starting to eclipse the highs we saw in 1989. And this could very well be one of the largest cup and handle patterns I've ever seen. With the cup potentially happening later on in this decade. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But just to point out that markets can come back.
Now, health care is another interesting one. Let me just dial this down to a three-year chart. Only recently did we break to record highs. Health care is the second best sector of the year. And a lot of that has to do with these weight loss drugs. But there are pockets in there also in biotech that have perked up recently.

Economic data releases and earnings
Stocks surged back Wednesday, reclaiming a portion of the steep losses suffered Tuesday following the hotter-than-expected headline inflation print that morning. Small caps led the way, with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gaining over 2% after suffering its worst day in years.
But the larger question for investors remains: Was Tuesday's rout a one-off or the start of something bigger?
The balance of evidence suggests this is a short-term pullback with fresh record highs coming in a few weeks — in other words, a buying opportunity.
And regardless of how the economic data lands over the next few weeks, it wouldn't be unusual for the S&P 500 to have a pullback after a blistering 20% rally off October lows, especially with where we are on the calendar.
As Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, noted on X, the next four weeks on the calendar haven't been great historically during the fourth year of a presidential term.
And with the index having gained ground in 14 of the last 15 weeks, a breather is to be expected.
""Seasonal weakness is normal,"" Detrick wrote.

However, tail risks are real, downside risks are non-trivial, and the best playbooks are highly nuanced.
Broadly speaking, the narratives driving soft landing expectations recently haven't changed appreciably.
As Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday, ""let's not get amped up when you get one month of CPI that was higher than what you expected it to be.""
Meanwhile, earnings growth, the engine of any bull market, remains strong — and the growth isn't limited to the Magnificent Seven, though they're definitely helping.
Further, most inflation metrics are still trending down. Tuesday's headline and core prints may have surprised expectations to the upside, but the year-over-year trends in both readings are heading lower.
Looking at the reaction in fed fund futures, Tuesday's inflation surprise only took about half of one 25-basis-point rate cut off the table.
But peering inside the CPI report and measuring some of the numbers on shorter time frames reveals a few trends keeping some investors up at night. So-called supercore inflation, which measures core services inflation after taking out housing, has turned up sharply.
This inflation measure, frequently mentioned by Fed Chair Powell, plummeted from an annual rate of 8% to 3% late last year but is back up to 5.5%. ""This isn't good news for markets,"" Alfonso Peccatiello, proprietor of The Macro Compass, said on X.

And once again, the stocks leading it higher are the biggest members of the benchmark average.
Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) have produced a nearly 20% return to start the year, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. The returns from these four stocks alone accounted for roughly 69% of the S&P 500's gain this year as of Thursday.
But not all of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks are off to a strong start. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) are having a choppier start to the year. For some on Wall Street, this has become a concern as a shrinking number of stocks are leading the major average higher.
Fortunately for investors, even if top stocks are peaking, the market should probably still go up.
A recent analysis from BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski showed that even when the top stocks driving an outsized part of the market action fall off, returns over the next year for the index historically have been quite good.
A chart from Belski shows that since 1992, on average, the S&P 500 has risen 14.3% in the year following a peak in contribution from the top 10 stocks in the benchmark average. The only time the S&P 500 delivered a negative return in the next year was in 2001 amid the fallout from the tech bubble.
""While some investors may be concerned that the market is likely to struggle without these stocks leading the way, our analysis shows that the S&P 500 has performed just fine following peaks in relative performance of the 10 largest stocks,"" Belski wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.
Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider pointed out that while the degree to which top stocks are dragging the major index higher is currently abnormally high, the idea that a few winners lead the S&P 500 gains isn't a new concept. In fact, Snider argued, in the long run it's been a typical feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.
""That's part of why the S&P 500 or the US equity market broadly has been so strong over the years. ... New companies grow, and they become larger weights in the index, and they drag the market higher with them,"" the analyst told Yahoo Finance. ""And eventually, there will be disruptors and new technologies that emerge and new businesses that emerge. And those will become larger. And then, it will be their turn to drag the market higher.""

The price of bitcoin briefly spiked more than $1,000 after the post on X claimed: “The SEC grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges.” Cryptocurrency investors had already driven bitcoin’s price above $46,000 in anticipation of the approval.

Moments later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler posted that ""The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.""
X confirmed the SEC’s account was compromised and said it was because of an “unidentified individual” obtaining control over a phone number associated with the agency’s account through a third party.
Bitcoin rallied immediately after the post, for a 1.5% gain on the day, but swiftly reversed on confirmation that the news was fake and the price slid as much as 2.5%.

Greggs said it does not plan to hike prices over the year ahead, but is unlikely to be able to offer price cuts as rising wages keep costs under pressure.
The group said 2023 sales rose 19.6% to £1.81bn from £1.51bn the year before and with like-for-like sales growth of 13.7%.
Greggs revealed plans to open up to another 160 stores in the year ahead and cheered a strong end to 2023.
The group opened a record 220 new shops over 2023, with 33 closures and 42 relocations leaving it with 145 new sites on a net basis and taking its total estate to 2,473.
Greggs is set to open between 140 and 160 new shops on a net basis in 2024 as it looks to give customers more convenient access to its stores.

Sainsbury’s backed its guidance for fiscal 2024 after reporting robust growth in grocery sales during the Christmas period.

The three ETFs are listed on Deutsche Borse and set to list on the London Stock Exchange and CBOE Amsterdam April 19 while Euronext Milan and Six Swiss Exchange listings are due “in the coming weeks.""
It brings the UCITS versions of the Ark's flagship $6.6 billion ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and its $1.36bn ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) to the continent for the first time, while the AI and robotics ETF is a freshly launched strategy for European investors. Each ETF has a total expense ratio of 0.75%.
The three ETFs are:
ARK Innovation UCITS ETF (ARKK)
ARK Genomic Revolution UCITS ETF (ARKG)
ARK Artificial Intelligence & Robotics UCITS ETF (ARKI)
ARKK targets companies involved in ‘disruptive innovation’, defined as businesses making technology-enabled new products or services that will “surpass the historical milestones of the first and second industrial revolutions”.
According to the group, it focuses on five innovation platforms comprising AI, robotics, multiomic sequencing, public blockchains and energy storage.
Wood, founder, CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, commented: “ARKK represents our best ideas, drawing from a decade-long track record to target companies at the forefront of disruptive innovation. With an existing $14 billion global asset base, we are excited to bring this strategy, designed with a five-year investment time horizon, to European investors.”
ARKG targets companies involved in the ‘genomic revolution’, focused on extending and enhancing the quality of human life via genomic sequencing, analysis, synthesis or composition.
It aims to invest across multiple sectors including healthcare, information technology, materials, energy and consumer discretionary.
Finally, ARKI will invest in businesses involved in AI, autonomous technology and robotics and is the only actively managed AI ETF in Europe.
The group hopes to capture demand for multi-thematic ETFs in Europe, backed by its strong research capabilities and reputation.
Wood added AI reduced the cost of the written word from $300-400 to mere cents, while AI training costs are falling 75% annually.
“This gives us confidence that AI will be the catalyst for dramatic change across the economy, heralding a future where global equity market value tied to innovation rises from 16% today to over 60% by 2030,” she said.
Wood added the launches are not just a result of increased interest from European investors, but a “declaration of our long-term commitment to Europe”.

ARKK,2024-10-04,Cathie Wood talks OpenAI investment and Tesla's robotaxi,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/cathie-wood-talks-openai-investment-222429812.html,"OpenAI recently raised $6.6 billion in a new funding round, giving it a valuation of about $157 billion. One firm that has been investing in OpenAI is Ark Invest.
Cathie Wood, ARK Invest's CEO and CIO, is betting big on AI. She says OpenAI, along with Anthropic, xAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) are ""stealing the march"" in the space.
While many investors are concerned about when companies will start seeing returns on their AI investments, Wood is hopeful. When asked about when OpenAI will start to turn a profit, she points to the development of agentic AI, which she thinks will open the door to more profitability, given that companies will be able to charge more for it.
Despite some recent executive departures at OpenAI, Wood is confident in the startup's leadership, praising both CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. She notes that ""what we witness in companies that are growing very quickly from startup into scaling is you need a different kind of management team.""

When it comes to competition between AI firms, Wood likes it. ""Competition is good. It's going to make this space more competitive and more effective, I think, longer term,"" she says.
On the possibility of a company like OpenAI going public, Wood argues ""a lot of companies are staying private longer. They just don't want to deal with the regulation in the public equity markets. And they also don't want to deal with the very short-term oriented or short-term investment time horizon of shareholders in the public equity markets."" However, she does think the public market could become more appealing with interest rates coming down and if investors were willing to stomach the longer-term time horizons some of these companies are working with.

ARKK,2024-07-23,Tesla's margins will be 'a sideshow' compared to robotaxi,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/teslas-margins-sideshow-compared-robotaxi-215452029.html,"Tesla (TSLA) has reported mixed second-quarter earnings, missing adjusted earnings expectations but beating revenue forecasts. Brett Winton, Ark Investment Management (ARKK) chief futurist joins Asking for a Trend to discuss the implications of this earnings report.
Despite Tesla's earnings miss, Winton argues that ""the real story"" lies in the company's potential to deliver on its robotaxi ambitions. He suggests that if Tesla succeeds in this venture, factors like gross margins and delivery numbers would become ""a sideshow"" in comparison.
Winton calls robotaxis ""an inevitability,"" driven by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. He cites Tesla's massive data center and its current fleet of vehicles as key advantages, leading him to believe ""they're gonna be able to deliver autonomous driving"".
Regarding the financial impact, Winton anticipates a robotaxi pilot could emerge between late 2024 and early 2025. He predicts this would transform Tesla's business model from ""one-time sales to recurring revenue,"" describing it as ""a business transformation the likes of which the world has never seen"".

ARKK,2024-07-11,Cathie Wood Defends ARK’s Strategy as Outflows Continue,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-defends-ark-strategy-221050110.html,"Cathie Wood, hailed as a star stock picker after her ARK innovation ETF (ARKK) surged over 150% in 2020, is facing a reality check after another rough year.
In a lengthy letter to investors, Wood acknowledged ARKK’s recent “challenged” performance, but said her “commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered.”
The flagship fund has seen nearly $1.9 billion in outflows over the last six months in 2024, pushing its assets under management down to $6.2 billion from $7.7 billion in late January. ARKK is down 12% year-over-year, significantly underperforming broad market indices. It's Thursday afternoon price of $45.75 is less than a third of what it was in early 2021.
Wood attributes the underperformance to the macro environment and some stock picks, but argues that many disruptive innovation stocks have entered “rare, deep value territory.”
She draws parallels to Amazon’s situation in 2002-2003, suggesting that current market conditions may be creating similar opportunities in companies like Pacific Biosciences and Crispr Therapeutics.
“Exiting our strategies now would crystallize losses that lower interest rates and reversions to the mean should transform into meaningful profits during the next few years,” Wood wrote, urging investors to stay the course.
The Case for Differentiated Exposure
The letter also addresses ARKK’s minimal exposure to the “Magnificent Six” tech giants that have driven much of the market’s gains. Wood defends this position, emphasizing the importance of diversified exposure to AI and other innovative technologies.
Despite the recent struggles, Wood points to ARKK’s 68% gain in 2023 as evidence that the strategy can outperform when market conditions align with her vision.
The contrast between Wood’s current challenges and her former status as an investing sensation is stark. In her letter, Wood argues that ARK’s strategies have “paid the dues associated with higher interest rates and are offering a highly differentiated exposure to innovation.”
She also indicates ARKK’s low valuation metrics compared to broad market indices as evidence of potential value, stating that the fund “seems to have entered deep value territory based on our five-year investment time horizon.”
Wood further suggests that if inflation and interest rates surprise on the low side of expectations, it could disproportionately benefit equities focused on disruptive innovation. Despite the recent struggles, she said she's resolute in her belief that ARK’s approach will ultimately reward patient investors.

A long-time supporter of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Wood joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the value Musk has brought to Tesla through his leadership.
Tesla shareholders have ultimately voted to approve Musk's pay package, valued at around $46 billion based on the company's current stock price, with the results revealed at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting early Thursday evening.
""Elon Musk has been incredibly important to Tesla and still is, not so much on the electric vehicle side — that's on automatic pilot, it's on the autonomous side,"" Wood says, emphasizing Musk's commitment to autonomous driving functions and integration of AI as to why she sees the stock soaring to $2,600.
Wood goes on to say that there's no other company that will be as impactful for humanity as Tesla under Musk: ""What many people don't understand is, the most important variable — once you've got the domain expertise and the AI expertise — is proprietary data. And Tesla has probably more proprietary data, than almost any company in the world. Elon Musk is the CEO of this age that we believe is going to best capitalize on the convergences between and among technologies...""

ARKK,2024-04-22,Actively Managed ETFs What Investors Need to Know,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/actively-managed-etfs-investors-know-153000144.html,"Actively managed ETFs are booming as total assets under management, now over $600 billion, have nearly doubled in the last two years.
In this deep-dive article, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of active ETFs, compare them to passively managed ETFs, explain what’s behind their recent growth, and we include a list of the top active ETFs as measured by AUM.
What Is an Actively Managed ETF?
An actively managed ETF is an exchange-traded fund that is managed by a portfolio manager or a team of managers who actively make investment decisions to try to outperform a specific benchmark or achieve a particular investment objective. This is in contrast to a passively managed ETF, which tracks a specific index and does not make any active trading decisions.
The largest active management ETF is the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) with $32 billion in assets, as of April 19, 2024. The 10 top active ETFs include a balance of equity funds and fixed income fund.
Actively Managed ETFs vs. Passively Managed ETFs
There are multiple differences between actively managed ETFs and passively managed ETFs, including the management style or investment strategy, potential for returns, fees and manager risk.
Investment Strategy
Actively managed ETFs are actively managed by a professional investment manager who makes decisions about which securities to include in the ETF's portfolio.
Passively managed ETFs track a specific index and do not make any active trading decisions.
Fees
Actively managed ETFs typically have higher fees because of the time and resources required for the manager and research team to actively seek and identify securities to hold in the portfolio. Higher frequency of trading can also increase costs.
Passively managed ETFs require few resources to manage and operate because these funds passively track the performance of an existing index of securities.
Potential for Returns
Actively managed ETFs have the potential to outperform the market if the investment manager makes better investment decisions than the market. However, there is no guarantee of outperformance.
Passively managed ETFs are designed to track the performance of the market, so they do not have the potential to outperform the market.
Manager Risk
Actively managed ETFs can be riskier than passively managed ETFs because the investment manager is making active trading decisions. These decisions can lead to losses if the market moves against the manager's predictions.
Passively managed ETFs are less risky because they are not making any active trading decisions.

ARKK,2024-04-19,Thematic ETFs: Timing Is Everything,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thematic-etfs-timing-everything-120000560.html,"First it was clean energy then artificial intelligence. Thematic ETFs offer exposure to structural long-term megatrends.
However, timing the entry point is just as important as selecting the right theme.
BlackRock’s clean energy ETF provides a perfect example of this. While the iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) returned 17.6% annualized over the five years to the end of June 2023, the annualized return for investors—based on inflows and outflows—was -5.5%, a 23 percentage point gap, according to Morningstar research.
This is an extreme example given the thematic ETF poster child saw $5.8 billion in inflows between November 2020 and January 2021; however, it highlights the challenge of not only selecting the right ETF but also choosing when to invest.
“Investor buying and selling habits connected with thematic funds over the last five years have destroyed considerable value,” Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst at Morningstar, warned.
“Fund investors are collectively poor market-timers and they particularly struggle in more volatile and exotic funds compared with more diversified core building blocks,"" he said.
This is especially pronounced for thematic ETFs that have more concentrated portfolios. In the search to offer the purest exposure to a particular megatrend, ETF issuers move down the market-cap spectrum, potentially leading to greater volatility.
“ETFs’ concentration results in high levels of volatility,” Lamont added. “More volatile funds seem to induce more frequent trading and a tendency to buy high and sell low. Most investors would achieve better investment outcomes by adopting a more patient buy-and-hold approach.”
As a result, demand for thematic ETFs has waned, with some investors concerned about the volatility and overlap with traditional sectors.
According to data from ETFbook, thematic ETFs have seen $116 million in outflows so far in 2024, as of March 22, adding to the $1.1 billion in net redemptions last year.
This is in stark contrast to the combined $16.3 billion in inflows in 2021 and 2022 as investors embraced the digital shift following the COVID-19 pandemic. Assets in thematic ETFs currently total $44 billion, as at the end of 2023.
How thematic ETFs fit within a multi-asset portfolio is a challenge for fund selectors, with questions around whether they remain a satellite holding or can be incorporated as a core building block.
“Thematic ETFs will likely always be used as an extension to allocations in more traditional sectors, and normally only in higher risk portfolios, as opposed to being standalone allocations within our strategic asset allocation,” Terry McGivern, senior research analyst at AJ Bell, told ETF Stream.

The three ETFs are listed on Deutsche Borse and set to list on the London Stock Exchange and CBOE Amsterdam April 19 while Euronext Milan and Six Swiss Exchange listings are due “in the coming weeks.""
It brings the UCITS versions of the Ark's flagship $6.6 billion ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and its $1.36bn ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) to the continent for the first time, while the AI and robotics ETF is a freshly launched strategy for European investors. Each ETF has a total expense ratio of 0.75%.
The three ETFs are:
ARK Innovation UCITS ETF (ARKK)
ARK Genomic Revolution UCITS ETF (ARKG)
ARK Artificial Intelligence & Robotics UCITS ETF (ARKI)
ARKK targets companies involved in ‘disruptive innovation’, defined as businesses making technology-enabled new products or services that will “surpass the historical milestones of the first and second industrial revolutions”.
According to the group, it focuses on five innovation platforms comprising AI, robotics, multiomic sequencing, public blockchains and energy storage.
Wood, founder, CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, commented: “ARKK represents our best ideas, drawing from a decade-long track record to target companies at the forefront of disruptive innovation. With an existing $14 billion global asset base, we are excited to bring this strategy, designed with a five-year investment time horizon, to European investors.”
ARKG targets companies involved in the ‘genomic revolution’, focused on extending and enhancing the quality of human life via genomic sequencing, analysis, synthesis or composition.
It aims to invest across multiple sectors including healthcare, information technology, materials, energy and consumer discretionary.
Finally, ARKI will invest in businesses involved in AI, autonomous technology and robotics and is the only actively managed AI ETF in Europe.

ARKK,2024-01-12,Spot bitcoin ETF issuers: What you need to know,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/spot-bitcoin-etf-issuers-know-201559908.html,"On Wednesday, January 10, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved eleven spot bitcoin ETFs. Among the approved spot bitcoin ETFs were ones from Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise. Yahoo Finance sat down with some of spot bitcoin ETF issuers this week. Here are some of their top takeaways.
Ark Invest Founder, CEO, & CIO Cathie Wood (00:00:17)
Ark Invest Founder, CEO, and CIO Cathie Wood notes three of the “competitive advantages” in Ark Invest's ETF, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). “One is our infrastructure and operation,” Wood says, “the second is research… The third competitive advantage we have is a sales force that started selling our exposure to bitcoin in 2016.” Wood adds, “we are looking at bitcoin as a public good. It is essentially, from a technology point of view… going to be the financial super highway of the internet.”
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein (00:01:09)
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein discusses “three things” regarding fees as the company’s spot bitcoin ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), is charging a 1.5% fee, which is above many of the other spot bitcoin ETF fees. “Number one, we made a commitment to our investors that we would lower our fees… we made good on that promise and we’ve reduced fees by 25 percent,” Sonnenshein explains. “Number two, investors should have choice… And three… GBTC is differentiated. It brings a market value to investors that I think they know and appreciate.”
Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan (00:02:02)
Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan explains “two things” he thinks investors will look for in spot bitcoin ETFs. One is “what is the lowest fee product, cause the less you pay the more you get in finance,” Hougan notes. “And then who has the support systems to provide research and answers and data to execute trades well… the combination of crypto expertise and low cost, we think is a winner for” the company's spot bitcoin ETF, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB).
WisdomTree Global Head of Research Christopher Gannatti (00:02:22)
WisdomTree Global Head of Research Christopher Gannatti discusses why “it's going to be among the most competitive dynamics that we believe we have seen at WisdomTree in the ETF industry.” “Everyone is providing exposure to the same underlying spot oriented bitcoin ETFs. Many of the providers also waving the fees to zero, at least initially for various points of time and amounts,” Gannatti notes. The firm manages its own bitcoin fund under the ticker (BTCW).
Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) (00:03:12)
Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) explains that “when the traditional financial services industry has now adopted and recognized the long-term benefits of bitcoin specifically, as part of a diversified asset allocation. It helps make the case for having a robust, regulatory framework for digital assets so that investors can begin to further diversify their investments and incorporate a long-term store of value like bitcoin into their investment strategies.”

Ark Invest (ARKK) Founder, CEO, and CIO Cathie Wood discusses the IPO market in 2024, Tesla, and a spot bitcoin ETF. ""Now what we're seeing is we're diversifying once again. We're adding back... some stocks that we've sold... we're looking forward to the IPO window opening again,"" Wood says, especially in AI, as well as other innovation spaces.

Wood adds, ""the outlook is bright for a... spot bitcoin ETF and we do think it will be in January.""
Automobili Pininfarina (PINF.MI) CEO Paolo Dellachà notes the ""key elements"" of being in ""the luxury segment"" as an ultra-luxury auto designer. ""To stay in the luxury segment, is definitely a lot about technology, about performance. But still the key elements of Battista and everything Pininfarina... will also develop in the future, start and originates from the vision about the design,"" Dellachà explains. ""For us, it was about embracing the future and also embracing the technology that not only allow us to have a car which is emission-free, is also allowing the car to have the highest level of performance that you can now achieve today.

Meredith Whitney LLC Founder Meredith Whitney explains the ""silver tsunami"" in the housing market in the U.S. ""The U.S. economy is remapping itself regionally,"" Whitney says, ""you see population migration going along the lines of economic opportunity and economic growth."" ""The other major demographic trend you see, is the aging of America... the 'silver tsunami' is 10,000 people a day turning 65 and by 2030, the entire baby boomer... generation will be over 65."" Whitney explains that ""AARP estimates that 51 percent of people over 50 downsized their home and people over 50 are 74 percent of total U.S. homeowners.

ARKK,2023-12-26,"Cathie Wood talks Tesla, Elon Musk, & spot bitcoin ETF approval",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/cathie-wood-talks-tesla-elon-231512374.html,"After paring back on Tesla (TSLA) shares in the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), the firm has recently started to add to its position again. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood tells Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman that the decisions by General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) to delay some of their EV investments was a ""telltale"" sign that Tesla is in position to gain market share, calling the automakers' decisions ""puzzling."" The move comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk's X platform (formerly Twitter) is suffering from a decline in ad revenue, raising concerns he may have to sell Tesla shares. Wood, however, doesn't seemed to be concerned, claiming that the platform's traffic is rising and that ultimately ""advertising will follow traffic."" ""His [Musk's] reason for buying X we believe is sound and will be successful,"" Wood adds.
Ark is one of the firms that has applied for a spot bitcoin ETF and is currently awaiting a decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Wood is hopeful that Ark's application will be approved, saying that ""After being denied several times by the SEC, without hearing from anyone at the SEC, we and others we know have gotten questions from the SEC, very thoughtful, detailed, technical questions. That's a very positive move."" Overall, she says the ""outlook is bright"" for a spot bitcoin ETF and that she does think approval will come in January. With bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rising in anticipation of an ETF approval, Wood does think investors will ""sell on the news,"" but that longer term, by the SEC approving these ETFs, institutional investors will be able to invest more in the crypto space, with those inflows helping to prop up the price.
When it comes to the flagship Ark Innovation ETF, Wood says the fund is ""diversifying once again. We are adding back some stocks that we sold and... we are looking forward to the IPO window opening again."" Wood thinks that with interest rates likely peaking, more companies could go public and that Ark will be ""eager investors."" So what companies is Wood hoping will go public? She says she would like to see companies like SpaceX, Anthropic, Databricks, and Discord hit the public market.

ARKK,2023-12-14,"The Fed took 'the lid off' market concerns, fueling stock market rally",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-took-the-lid-off-market-concerns-fueling-stock-market-rally-190431047.html,"The Federal Reserve laid out an ideal scenario for investors on Wednesday.
Inflation is falling faster than initially thought. More interest rate cuts than previously expected are on the horizon. And the economy, while cooling from its too-hot pace, is still growing.
In other words, a soft landing is in sight, and investors have taken that to mean it's time to go fishing in stocks that had previously been hammered by fears of higher interest rates.
The interest rate sensitive Real Estate sector is leading the market action on Thursday, rising more than 2.5%. The Russell 2000 (^RUT), which had reversed all of its post-pandemic gains earlier this year over fears of higher rates, is now up more than 11% in the last month alone.
The S&P regional bank index (KRE) has risen more than 20% over the past the month, including a nearly 5% gain on Thursday. Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up north of 3% on Thursday alone.
Many of those areas of the market have already surged through November amid stocks' best month since 2022, but now as the path to rate cuts has become even more clear, they're keeping momentum into December too.
Powell's comments on Wednesday ""took the lid off the market's concerns,"" CFRA's chief investment strategist Sam Stovall told Yahoo Finance Live. And now, Stovall says, the market ""has further to run.""

The moves have brought the major averages near record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained nearly 500 points on Wednesday, breaching 37,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is back above 4,700 and closing in on its January 2022 record high of 4,796.
And within the indexes, single-stock moves have stood out for companies that have struggled throughout 2023. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) had both been down double digits this year at the end of October. Now they're in the green for 2023 as shares in both major banks popped about 5% on Thursday alone.
""Not surprisingly, Financials and Real Estate have been on the top because those are the ones that had been pressured the most because of the higher rates,"" Stovall said.
The moves fall in line with what some of Wall Street's most bullish strategists had flagged over the past month in 2024 outlooks.
BMO's Brian Belski placed Financials as an Overweight amid his call for the S&P 500 to hit 5,100 in 2024.
""There is no denying that most institutional and global investors are very underexposed and have been overemphasizing the negative 'what-ifs,'"" Belski wrote.

The S&P regional bank index (KRE) rose more than 16% during the month, including a more than 2% gain on Wednesday. Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) gained more than 34%. Meme stocks are soaring too, with the broad Roundhill Meme ETF (MEME) rising more than 20% in November and meme stock favorite GameStop moving up over 20% on Wednesday alone.
The small cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT), which had been largely avoided due to fears that high interest rates would sink small companies, gained more than 9% in the month.

Sosnick adds that the root of what he described as a fear of missing out, or ""FOMO"" rally, is the ""expectation that rates will be coming down, and that is indeed a solid reason for a rise in risk assets.""

Fears of another Fed rate hike had weighed on the broader indexes and particularly on tech stocks, between the Fed's September meeting and the one on Nov. 1.
When the S&P 500 (^GSPC) bottomed in late October, institutional investors were caught ""flat-footed,"" eToro US investment analyst Callie Cox told Yahoo Finance. According to a measure by the National Association of Active Investment Managers, investors were their least exposed to equities in more than a year.
So as signs of cooling inflation built a case for investors to believe the Fed may not only be done hiking but could even cut rates soon, they piled into interest rate-sensitive sectors throughout last month in an effort to ""performance chase,"" Cox said. Real Estate (XLRE) and Technology (XLK) gained more than 12% in November while Financials (XLF) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) rose more than 10%.
""Many [institutional investors] are rushing into these high-duration sectors, which is powering the rate cut trade, and that could last until the end of the year,"" Cox said.

Now with that active managers index at its highest level since the top of the AI-driven rally in the summer, the key question for investors will be if markets have too aggressively priced in rate cuts and if investors are overall too bullish on stocks despite myriad headwinds headed into 2024.
For its part, the Federal Reserve has attempted to temper expectations about rate cuts.

ARKK,2023-11-15,"Cathie Wood talks spot bitcoin ETF approval, Tesla, & the Fed",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/cathie-wood-talks-spot-bitcoin-140420951.html,"ARK Investments Founder, CEO, and Chief Investment Officer Cathie Wood is known for big, bullish bets on investments such as Tesla (TSLA) and bitcoin (BTC-USD). Now she's teaming up with 21shares on new crypto-based ETFs. Wood is bullish on bitcoin, with a base case of $600,000-$650,00, though she believes it could go even higher if a spot bitcoin ETF is approved. On the topic of a spot bitcoin ETF, something ARK Invest has applied for, Wood believes ""something has changed,"" because the Securities and Exchange Commission followed up to their latest application with questions instead of rejecting it outright. For Wood, this is a sign that the odds of approval ""have gone up.""
When asked by Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman about the economy, Wood argues that weakness in the housing and auto markets are showing signs of a recession, adding that based on what she has heard on earnings calls ""you'd think we're in a recession."" Wood says the Federal Reserve is paying attention to lagging indicators, one of which is the Consumer Price Index, which she thinks will ""turn negative before all is said and done.""
For a long time, Tesla was the top holding in the ARK portfolio. It has now dropped to third. Wood explains that it had more to do with rebalancing the portfolio than the stock. When it comes to Tesla's price cuts, Wood says “all that Tesla’s price cuts have done is offset the interest rate hit. So really, the monthly payments haven’t gone anywhere. Tesla will continue to cut prices because it can, its technology costs are falling and it’s profitable.” Wood goes on to say ""you'll notice that the GM (GM) and Ford (F) have basically pulled back on their EV strategy and said, 'we can't, we can't do this unless it's profitable.' Well, this is chicken and the egg. It can't be profitable for them, just like it wasn't for Tesla until they scale. So if they're not gonna scale, they won't be profitable.""

ARKK,2023-11-14,Cathie Wood: Odds of spot bitcoin ETF approval have gone up,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/cathie-wood-odds-spot-bitcoin-223701300.html,"ARK Invest is teaming up with 21shares to launch new crypto-focused ETFs. ARK Invest Founder and CEO Cathie Wood says the partnership made sense given how complementary the firms' areas of expertise are. Wood says that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is ""the first global, digital, private rules based monetary system in history"" adding that global monetary policy is ""unhinged, it's not hinged to anything except human decision-making"" and that ""the monetary system is bitcoin.""
Ark is one of the several firm trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Wood says ""something has changed,"" noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission has responded to their application with questions instead of just rejecting it. Wood believes this means that the odds of approval have gone up. Overall, Wood is still bull on bitcoin, saying her base case for the cryptocurrency is $600,000-$650,000. However, she thinks it could go higher, given the currency's scarcity and the potential for more institutional investment if a spot bitcoin ETF is approved.

Video Transcript
JULIE HYMAN: One of the assets that perhaps surprisingly was not rising today was bitcoin, even though it has rallied as of late today, falling by some 3.4%. And it's on this day that Cathie Wood announced or ARK Invest announced in cooperation with 21shares. It's going to be launching a new suite of digital asset ETFs. They will be actively managed.
And I had the chance to talk to her about digital assets, broadly about these products specifically, and, of course, about her still bullish stance on cryptocurrency.
CATHIE WOOD: This is the first global, digital, private, rules-based monetary system in history. It's a very big idea. When we wrote the paper in collaboration with Art Laffer-- you know Art Laffer supply-side economics, Laffer curve-- he said, I've been waiting for this since they closed the gold window in 1971. So he's been waiting 50 years for this, right? And he's so excited about everything crypto, but especially bitcoin, because he believes, and it is true, monetary policy around the world is unhinged. It's not hinged to anything except human decision making.
And this is going to put discipline, rigor back into--
JULIE HYMAN: These particular products you're talking.
CATHIE WOOD: Well, bitcoin is. The monetary system is bitcoin. And so, yes, the-- why now for these? We've been working with 21shares since I met Ophelia at an ETF confab in 2018. They had really just started their business. And I said, you know, we want to move towards crypto. You are completely crypto. They were focused on the infrastructure, the regulations, really blazing a trail. They had to invent things in order to make this happen.

ARKX,2024-10-04,Cathie Wood talks OpenAI investment and Tesla's robotaxi,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/cathie-wood-talks-openai-investment-222429812.html,"OpenAI recently raised $6.6 billion in a new funding round, giving it a valuation of about $157 billion. One firm that has been investing in OpenAI is Ark Invest.
Cathie Wood, ARK Invest's CEO and CIO, is betting big on AI. She says OpenAI, along with Anthropic, xAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) are ""stealing the march"" in the space.
While many investors are concerned about when companies will start seeing returns on their AI investments, Wood is hopeful. When asked about when OpenAI will start to turn a profit, she points to the development of agentic AI, which she thinks will open the door to more profitability, given that companies will be able to charge more for it.
Despite some recent executive departures at OpenAI, Wood is confident in the startup's leadership, praising both CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. She notes that ""what we witness in companies that are growing very quickly from startup into scaling is you need a different kind of management team.""

When it comes to competition between AI firms, Wood likes it. ""Competition is good. It's going to make this space more competitive and more effective, I think, longer term,"" she says.
On the possibility of a company like OpenAI going public, Wood argues ""a lot of companies are staying private longer. They just don't want to deal with the regulation in the public equity markets. And they also don't want to deal with the very short-term oriented or short-term investment time horizon of shareholders in the public equity markets."" However, she does think the public market could become more appealing with interest rates coming down and if investors were willing to stomach the longer-term time horizons some of these companies are working with.
Watch the video above to hear Wood discuss Tesla (TSLA) and its upcoming robotaxi event.

ARKX,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

ARKX,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

ARKX,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

ARKX,2024-10-02,"Coupang, Inc. (CPNG) Stock Drops Despite Market Gains: Important Facts to Note",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coupang-inc-cpng-stock-drops-220020340.html,"Coupang, Inc. (CPNG) closed the latest trading day at $24.19, indicating a -0.98% change from the previous session's end. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.01%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.09%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.08%.
Heading into today, shares of the company had gained 11.05% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 5.59% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.21% in that time.
The investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Coupang, Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.02, indicating a 60% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $7.79 billion, indicating a 26.04% upward movement from the same quarter last year.
For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of -$0.02 per share and a revenue of $30.57 billion, signifying shifts of -107.69% and +25.36%, respectively, from the last year.
Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Coupang, Inc. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.
Our research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. Coupang, Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
From a valuation perspective, Coupang, Inc. is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 180.96. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.58, so one might conclude that Coupang, Inc. is trading at a premium comparatively.
It's also important to note that CPNG currently trades at a PEG ratio of 179.17. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.04 based on yesterday's closing prices.

He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.
Watch the video above to hear some of Rosenbluth's ETF plays for the port strike affecting the US's East and Gulf Coasts.

ARKX,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

ARKX,2024-10-02,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Opendoor Technologies vs. Realty Income,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stock-buy-now-opendoor-110500483.html,"Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN) and Realty Income (NYSE: O) represent two very different ways to invest in the real estate market. Opendoor streamlines home sales by making instant cash offers for houses, repairing them, and relisting them for sale on its first-party online marketplace. Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that buys and rents out thousands of commercial properties to a wide range of businesses.
Opendoor initially impressed growth-oriented investors, while Realty Income mostly attracted conservative dividend investors. But over the past three years, Opendoor's stock plunged 90% as Realty Income's stock only dipped 2%. Let's see why Realty Income outperformed Opendoor by such a wide margin -- and if it's still the better buy as interest rates gradually decline.
Image source: Getty Images.
Opendoor sticks with its capital-intensive business model
Opendoor's ""iBuying"" business of flipping houses is a capital-intensive one which can challenging even when interest rates are low. Supply chain constraints can make it difficult to renovate all of the houses it buys, and its own AI algorithms can cause it to overpay for houses. That's why Zillow and Redfin both shuttered their first-party iBuying services in 2022.
Inflation and rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure over the past two years. The housing market cooled, and it cost even more money to repair and relist its properties. Back in 2021, Opendoor purchased nearly six times as many houses than it did in 2020 as the pandemic-driven headwinds for the industry dissipated.
However, the compamy bought 5% fewer homes in 2022 and 68% fewer homes in 2023. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins also turned negative in both years even as it reined in spending.
Opendoor's revenue surged 211% in 2021 and jumped 94% in 2022, but plunged 55% to $6.9 billion in 2023 as rising rates choked the housing market. On the bright side, the company narrowed its net loss from a staggering $1.4 billion in 2022 to $275 million in 2023. Opendoor's revenue continued to decline in the first half of 2024, but it expects to finally end its seven-quarter streak of year-over-year revenue declines in the third quarter of 2024 as the housing market improves.
For the full year, analysts expect Opendoor's revenue to decline 26% to $5.2 billion as its adjusted EBITDA improves from negative $627 million to negative $183 million. But from 2024 to 2026, they expect its revenue to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% to $9.5 billion as its adjusted EBITDA turns positive by the final year. Based on those optimistic estimates, its stock looks dirt cheap at less than one times this year's sales.

ARKX,2024-10-02,"With 56% ownership of the shares, Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/56-ownership-shares-coupang-inc-110015739.html,"Key Insights
Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Coupang's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions
A total of 6 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership
Recent sales by insiders
To get a sense of who is truly in control of Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 56% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coupang, beginning with the chart below.
View our latest analysis for Coupang
ownership-breakdown
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coupang?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Coupang already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coupang's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
earnings-and-revenue-growth
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Coupang is not owned by hedge funds. SB Investment Advisers (UK) Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 19% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 9.6% by the third-largest shareholder. Bom Suk Kim, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer.
We did some more digging and found that 6 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.

ARKX,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

It's not too late to play the China stimulus rally: Strategist

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

ARKX,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

ARKX,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

ARKX,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market.

The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).

(NYSE:CPNG) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message.

Coupang Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Financial Officer, Gaurav Anand, sold US$4.6m worth of shares at a price of US$22.75 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$24.81). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 10% of Gaurav Anand's holding.
Insiders in Coupang didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Coupang Insiders Are Selling The Stock
The last three months saw significant insider selling at Coupang. In total, insiders sold US$4.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.
Insider Ownership
Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Coupang insiders own 10.0% of the company, currently worth about US$4.5b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

ARKX,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

CIBR,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

CIBR,2024-06-05,Cybersecurity ETFs Surge After CrowdStrike Results,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cybersecurity-etfs-surge-crowdstrike-results-225546964.html,"Shares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike soared on Wednesday after reporting strong earnings results, lending support to an industry that has faced some headwinds recently.
CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. gained nearly 10% midday Wednesday after it said that revenues in the first quarter grew by 33% to $921 million, ahead of the $905 million consensus analyst estimate.
Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.93 versus the $0.90 that analysts were expecting.
With a $81 billion market cap, CrowdStrike is the second-largest pureplay cybersecurity company, behind only Palo Alto Networks, which is worth $95 billion.
However, CrowdStrike has trounced its rival in performance this year, with a gain of 31.5% versus 0.2%.
Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks Inc. plummeted by 28% in a single session after cutting its revenue outlook for the current year.
More recently, software stocks broadly tanked after Salesforce Inc. forecast underwhelming growth for this year, raising worries that customers were prioritizing spending on AI over traditional software offerings.
But CrowdStrike is bucking the trend, with shares trading close to all-time highs. And the company is touting its AI capabilities.
“We built the right architecture from the start— the industry's lightest weight, easiest to install sensor embedded with AI, no system reboot required, a single AI-native platform console, not disparate stitch together or siloed multi-platforms,” CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said on the latest conference call.
ETFs With Large CrowdStrike Holdings
With a 7% weighting, CrowdStrike is the largest holding for both the First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR), as well as the Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG).
Its 7% weighting makes it the No.2 largest holding in the Amplify Cybersecurity ETF (HACK).
Cybersecurity ETFs have underperformed this year, with returns ranging from flat (HACK) to -4.1% (BUG).
The struggles of Palo Alto Networks and software stocks broadly have weighed on the ETFs.
However, CrowdStrike’s strong results may act as a tailwind for the funds. On Wednesday, all three of the ETFs were trading up by around 2%.
CrowdStrike and its competitors provide a mission critical service to their customers. Thus, despite the hype around generative AI, demand for cybersecurity services is unlikely to falter, they argue.
CrowdStrike raised its revenue forecast for the year to $3.98 billion to $4.01 billion, up from $3.92 billion to $3.99 billion previously. That represents growth of more than 30% year-over-year.

CIBR,2024-04-19,Thematic ETFs: Timing Is Everything,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thematic-etfs-timing-everything-120000560.html,"First it was clean energy then artificial intelligence. Thematic ETFs offer exposure to structural long-term megatrends.
However, timing the entry point is just as important as selecting the right theme.
BlackRock’s clean energy ETF provides a perfect example of this. While the iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) returned 17.6% annualized over the five years to the end of June 2023, the annualized return for investors—based on inflows and outflows—was -5.5%, a 23 percentage point gap, according to Morningstar research.
This is an extreme example given the thematic ETF poster child saw $5.8 billion in inflows between November 2020 and January 2021; however, it highlights the challenge of not only selecting the right ETF but also choosing when to invest.
“Investor buying and selling habits connected with thematic funds over the last five years have destroyed considerable value,” Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst at Morningstar, warned.
“Fund investors are collectively poor market-timers and they particularly struggle in more volatile and exotic funds compared with more diversified core building blocks,"" he said.
This is especially pronounced for thematic ETFs that have more concentrated portfolios. In the search to offer the purest exposure to a particular megatrend, ETF issuers move down the market-cap spectrum, potentially leading to greater volatility.
“ETFs’ concentration results in high levels of volatility,” Lamont added. “More volatile funds seem to induce more frequent trading and a tendency to buy high and sell low. Most investors would achieve better investment outcomes by adopting a more patient buy-and-hold approach.”
As a result, demand for thematic ETFs has waned, with some investors concerned about the volatility and overlap with traditional sectors.
According to data from ETFbook, thematic ETFs have seen $116 million in outflows so far in 2024, as of March 22, adding to the $1.1 billion in net redemptions last year.
This is in stark contrast to the combined $16.3 billion in inflows in 2021 and 2022 as investors embraced the digital shift following the COVID-19 pandemic. Assets in thematic ETFs currently total $44 billion, as at the end of 2023.
How thematic ETFs fit within a multi-asset portfolio is a challenge for fund selectors, with questions around whether they remain a satellite holding or can be incorporated as a core building block.
“Thematic ETFs will likely always be used as an extension to allocations in more traditional sectors, and normally only in higher risk portfolios, as opposed to being standalone allocations within our strategic asset allocation,” Terry McGivern, senior research analyst at AJ Bell, told ETF Stream.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then Chris, as you look at AI, of course, it goes hand in hand with cybersecurity. Obviously, been on the minds of regulators. We saw that snafu with the SEC, their Twitter account, their X account being hacked with that false announcement. A simple two-factor authentication apparently could have prevented some of that. But what does that tell you about how much cybersecurity should also be in people's portfolios as they also balance some of these big tech stocks that are focused on AI?
CHRIS VERSACE: We have said and we will continue to say the following, as we move deeper and deeper into this increasingly connected world, which will only accelerate because of the use of AI, there are a number of reasons to be long-term bullish on cybersecurity, but also data privacy as well.
And I would say, look, there's a bunch of high profile cybersecurity stocks out there; Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, F5, and the like. For a lot of folks, the easier way might simply be to own an ETF, whether it's the HACK ETF, the CIBR ETF, H-A-C-K or C-I-B-R, other ticker symbols. You get great broad-based exposure in a rapidly-evolving industry, almost a constant one-upmanship between the attackers and the protectors. And I like that well-rounded coverage because you're not making any one particular bet. But make no mistake, Rachelle. Investors, you have to own cybersecurity.

Fitzpatrick, who will leave State Street at the end of July after nearly two decades at the firm, will be responsible for expanding JPMorgan’s product solutions for active and passive ETF issuers, according to an internal memo seen by ETF Stream.
He will also drive the group’s operating model to “deliver margin and scale” for JPMorgan clients.
Based in Dublin, he will report to JPMorgan's global head of custody Hannah Elson and global head of ETF product Fearghal Woods.
“The ETF market continues to attract a rising share of investor capital and remains a key priority for asset managers across the globe,” the memo from Elson and Woods said.
“As we invest across the entire ETF ecosystem to capture this growing wallet, we are pleased to announce that Ciaran Fitzpatrick will join the firm as global head of ETF product management.”
State Street's Global Team
Fitzpatrick has over 21 years of experience in the funds industry and has spent 17 years at State Street, most recently as managing director, head of ETF solutions Europe.
Prior to this, he spent four years as a senior manager at Investors Bank and Trust.
In a statement, State Street said: “Ciaran has informed us of his intention to leave State Street at the end of July to pursue another opportunity, and we wish him well.
“Ciaran leaves behind him an incredibly strong team of experienced ETF specialists backed by a broader, global team of close to 175 ETF service and operations specialists.""

JEPQ,2024-05-10,Defiance Unveils Income Generating Oil Fund,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defiance-unveils-income-generating-oil-211238510.html,"Defiance ETFs, the themes-focused issuer often known for making bold options plays, unveiled its first oil and income focused fund on Friday to address investor demand for a variety of income generating products.
The Defiance Oil Enhanced Options Income ETF (USOY), which is actively managed, uses put options to offer investors income as well as indirect exposure to the United States Oil Fund (USO), the largest pure play oil fund in the United States.
“Traders invested in the commodity could potentially benefit from not only the price of oil, but also the additional premium our fund may achieve through selling slightly in the money puts,” explained Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs.
Options ETFs' popularity has surged over the past year, partially due to the success of the $33 billion JPMorgan Premium Income (JEPI), which brought in nearly $13 billion in inflows last year.
Defiance, which was founded in 2018, has nine ETFs trading with about $1.4 billion in assets. The issuer employs strategies such as options and leverage in many of its funds, including the Defiance Nasdaq 100 Enhanced Options Income ETF (QQQY), as well as the Defiance R2000 Enhanced Options Income ETF (IWMY). 
Oil Prices in 2024
Amid geopolitical instability and shortened supply, oil prices climbed earlier in the year, making ETFs in the energy category some of 2024's best performers.
Yet over the past month, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures declined about 7%, even as the United States Oil Fund (USO) gained roughly 1%. This disparity could be due to the cost of product remaining high despite the spot price of oil falling, according to reporting from etf.com's Jeff Benjamin.
Jablonski highlighted that with oil and energy down over 2023, ETFs in the sector are still “proving to have investment return potential in ’24,” she said.
The largest Defiance ETF is the Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG), which has $542.3 million in assets under management.

JEPQ,2024-05-06,Active ETFs: The Death of Smart Beta?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/active-etfs-death-smart-beta-120000978.html,"The rise of active ETFs in Europe has sparked questions about the role of smart beta within multi-asset portfolios, an asset class that has struggled to gain traction over the past decade.
Active investing is the latest trend to take the European ETF market by storm as investors pile into quantitative-driven ETFs from the likes of JP Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) and Fidelity International.
According to data from Morningstar, active ETFs saw €2.1b billon flows in Q1, taking the segment’s overall assets under management (AUM) to €33.6 billion, up from €5.7 billion at the start of 2015.
Last quarter was a different story for smart beta ETFs which suffered €1.5 billion outflows as investors turned away from value and risk-orientated products.
The asset class has never exceeded 8% market share of European ETFs, a sign it has “reached its potential”, according to Monika Calay, director, manager research, at Morningstar.
Smart beta ETFs that offer exposure to factors such as value, size or low volatility have often left investors disappointed due to their high correlation with their parent benchmarks and higher fees.
Active ETFs vs Smart Beta
According to analysis conducted by Finominal, many smart beta ETFs have a correlation of more than 0.9 to the S&P 500, highlighting the potential construction challenges of creating a long-only factor exposure.
In response, active ETFs have launched with the promise of incremental outperformance via a quantitative-driven approach to stock selection.
These strategies have resonated the most with investors as highlighted by the JPM US Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) UCITS ETF (JREU) which has ballooned to $7.1 billion AUM since launching in October 2018, the largest active ETF in Europe.
“In Europe, the active ETF landscape is biased toward lower-alpha, lower-active share products, as well as quantitative and sustainability-tilted products, in both equities and fixed income,” Calay explained.
“Given that an increasing number of active managers are considering the merits of packaging and distributing their investment strategies in an ETF format, we expect the menu of available options to expand significantly as new entrants join the race.”
Calay said switching from a smart beta to an active approach allows flexibility to navigate changing market environments and “exploit pockets of value” that are not captured in a rules-based approach.
One example of this came in late in 2020 after Pfizer announced positive vaccine results, a move that drove outperformance in value stocks. However, BlackRock’s momentum ETFs were unable to capture this switch from growth to value until May 2021 when the underlying index rebalanced.

JEPQ,2024-04-18,Active ETFs Gain Appeal Amid Volatility,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/active-etfs-gain-appeal-amid-210859138.html,"As the bull market for stocks starts looking long in the tooth, and inflation, interest rates and growing geopolitical unrest boost market volatility, investors and financial advisors are leaning more heavily on actively managed ETFs in typical late-cycle fashion.
During the year's first three months, $60 billion, or 30%, of all ETF flows went into actively managed exchange-traded funds, according to a recent Fidelity Investments report. Active ETFs punched above their weight class, since they account for just 7% of total ETF assets.
“One of last year’s burgeoning trends was the increasing prevalence of actively managed ETFs,” the report stated.
That trend carried into the first quarter of this year with active ETFs representing 90 of the 138 ETFs launched so far this year, according to Fidelity’s research.
Passive indexed strategies still dominate ETF flows, with $132 billion worth of net flows into indexed ETFs during the quarter.
Chris Shuba, chief executive and founder of Helios Quantitative Research in Granite City, Calif., said diversification is moving front and center with financial advisors, especially after the past few years of seeing a handful of stocks dominate many of the broad market indexes.
“I believe the Mag Seven, as a group, are a strong representation of innovation and potential in the technology and near-technology space,” he said. “I wouldn't argue to completely divest from the Mag Seven, but diversification could be very beneficial at this stage.”
Among the largest actively managed ETFs, the$32.6 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) brought in $1.64 billion during the quarter, according to etf.com data. The $11.9 billion JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) brought in $2.57 billion.
While the growing trend toward active management is a popular move when the broad markets start slipping, Fidelity’s research shows some investors are still following familiar patterns.
For example, of the roughly $200 billion of inflows into U.S. ETFs during the first three months of the year, more than half of those net flows went into U.S. equity funds.
Beneath the flows into indexes, the research shows technology-focused ETFs leading all sectors in terms of net flows at $9.5 billion, while utility sector ETFs led on the other end with $2.3 billion worth of net outflows.
John Khoury, senior wealth manager at Savvy Advisors in Boson, views the money in motion as a prudent strategy for avoiding letting portfolios become too “top heavy.”
“It’s important to rebalance portfolios that have become over-exposed to stocks relative to bonds, cash, and alternative investments given the strong stock market performance over the last year,” he said. “Although bonds aren’t as exciting as stocks, they do offer attractive yields that can help reduce volatility and risk for an investor’s portfolio, especially for investors close to retirement or in-retirement.”

KRBN,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

KRBN,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

KRBN,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

KRBN,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

KRBN,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

KRBN,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

KRBN,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

KRBN,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

KRBN,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In a lower interest rate environment, Powers focuses on traditional defensive sectors like utilities (XLU), consumer staples XLP (XLP), and financials XLF (XLF), noting that “we still expect some short-term volatility as we enter October, which is historically the most volatile month of the year in election years.”

So there's less competition which can make it easier to snag a deal on a home. At the same time, you might see lower rates if you wait into the spring. But you might have to offset those lower rates with more competition and better prices. You know, in essence, I don't think buyers can go wrong either way,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

KRBN,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

KRBN,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

KRBN,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

KRBN,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

MSFU,2024-06-05,Direxion META Single-Stock ETFs Wrap Mag-7 Lineup,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/direxion-meta-single-stock-etfs-205126659.html,"Direxion, which manages more than $40.1 billion in 85 ETFs, launched a pair of funds that offer leveraged long and short exposure to Meta Platforms Inc., filling out its Magnificent Seven single-stock lineup.
The Direxion Daily META Bull 2X Shares ETF (METU) and the Direxion META Bear 1X Shares ETF (METD) complete Direxion’s Mag Seven single-stock ETF lineup that was initiated in August 2022 with exchange-traded funds offering levered and short exposure to Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. New York-based Direxion added single-stock ETF exposure to Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.  in September 2022 and Nvidia Corp. a year later.
The deliberate pace of the rollout, which began shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission started allowing single-stock ETFs, was pegged to anticipated investor appetite, according to Ed Egilinsky, managing director at New York-based Direxion.
“We wanted to see how the single-stock ETFs would be received, and we thought some of the other single stocks might be more readily traded,” he said.
Direxion's Full Slate of Mag Seven ETFs
Because the single-stock ETFs make long or short bets and the price resets daily, share price volatility is an important factor for attracting active investors and day traders.
“Single-stock ETFs have exploded in popularity recently,” said etf.com Senior ETF Analyst Sumit Roy, who cited the success of the GraniteShares 2X Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which has grown to $3 billion.
Another example of appeal in the category is the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares ETF (TSLL) at $1 billion.
“These are numbers that a lot of people wouldn't have believed when single-stock ETFs launched less than two years ago,” Roy added.
The leverage on six Mag Seven single-stock ETFs that Direxion launched prior to the META versions were each changed from 1.5 times leverage to 2 times leverage in April to reach the maximum allowed leverage for single-stock ETFs.
Across Direxion’s ETF lineup, Egilinsky said three of the top 10 funds in terms of inflows this year are single-stock ETFs.
As trading vehicles, the levered and inverse ETFs can see wild moves in terms of inflows and outflows, Egilinsky said.
“With the market rallying we’ve seen some top inflows in our bear products,” he said.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the labor market added 254,000 payrolls in September, more additions than the 150,000 expected by economists.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, from 4.2% in August. September job additions came in higher than the revised 159,000 added in August. Revisions to both the July and August report showed the US economy added 72,000 more jobs during those two months than previously reported.
Wage growth, an important measure for gauging inflation pressures, rose to 4% year over year, from a 3.9% annual gain in August. On a monthly basis, wages increased 0.4%, in line with August's reading.
The key question entering Friday's report was whether the data would reflect significant cooling in the labor market, which could prompt another large Fed interest rate cut. Robert Sockin, Citi senior global economist, told Yahoo Finance that the better-than-expected jobs report makes it less likely the Fed moves with the ""urgency"" it did at its September meeting when the central bank cut interest rates by half a percentage point.
""This pushes the Fed out a lot,"" he said, adding that it's uncertain the Fed will make a 50 basis point cut again this year.

Following the report, markets were pricing in a roughly 5% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by half a percentage point in November, down from a 53% chance seen a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.
""Looking at the labour market strength evident in September’s employment report, the real debate at the Fed should be about whether to loosen monetary policy at all,"" Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""Any hopes of a [50 basis point] cut are long gone.""
Futures tied to major US stock indexes rallied on the news. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) put on nearly 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) added roughly 0.5%. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) moved 1.1% higher.
Renaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note following the release that September's jobs report was ""undeniably good news"" for the equity market.
""At the end of the day, the Fed is still cutting policy rates even as the economy grows,"" Dutta wrote.

QQQ,2024-10-04,Is Invesco QQQ Trust a Millionaire Maker?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-qqq-trust-millionaire-maker-110500368.html,"Investors are likely familiar with the S&P 500, an index of 500 large and profitable U.S.-based businesses. This is often viewed as the bellwether for how the overall stock market is performing.
However, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) deserves attention from investors, since it has crushed the S&P 500 in recent times. This exchange-traded fund (ETF) could continue to supercharge returns. But is it a millionaire maker?
Portfolio composition
The Invesco QQQ Trust differs from the S&P 500 because it tracks the performance of just 100 stocks. These are the biggest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq stock exchange, known as the Nasdaq 100 Index.
Investors should understand what areas of the economy shine brightly in this ETF. The information technology sector commands a hefty 50.3% weighting in the Invesco QQQ Trust. Businesses that are part of the ""Magnificent Seven"" combined make up a notable 42.5% of the whole portfolio. Therefore, the performance of these stocks has a big influence.
This has been a benefit in the past few years. Companies in this group of seven are driven by powerful tech-enabled tailwinds, which has boosted their prospects. Digital advertising, cloud computing, digital payments, electric vehicles, online shopping, and streaming entertainment are some trends to pay attention to.
The average investor who wants exposure to these tailwinds doesn't need to pick single stocks. Buying and holding the Invesco QQQ Trust provides adequate exposure.
Fantastic performance
While it's crucial to know what this ETF holds, investors are certainly more worried about performance -- what matters when it comes to generating long-term wealth.
In the past five years, the Invesco QQQ Trust has produced a total return of 169%. A $10,000 investment made in September 2019 would be worth almost $27,000 today. That's an impressive gain for a passive investment vehicle, and it trounces the S&P 500.
What's also worth mentioning is the cost of owning this ETF. The expense ratio is just 0.20%. This means that for every $10,000 you invest, just $20 is earmarked for annual dues. That's hard to beat.
Cathie Wood and her firm ARK Invest have received a lot of attention in recent years. Investors like the focus on owning innovative and disruptive companies, which is similar to the strategy of the Invesco QQQ Trust.
However, the ARK Innovation ETF, ARK Invest's main fund, charges an expense ratio of 0.75% but has only returned 16% in the last five years. The performance has disappointed greatly, even though this fund costs nearly four times as much as the Invesco QQQ Trust.

QQQ,2024-10-04,Here Are My 2 Favorite ETFs in October,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-favorite-etfs-october-092200822.html,"There is little doubt that the best way for the average person to create wealth over the long term is through investing. While over 60% of Americans own stocks, most of that is through buying into funds that own multiple stocks. The direct ownership of stocks accounts for a little over 20%.
For most people, investing in stocks through vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a great option. Let's look at two ETFs I'd be buying this month with cash I have available for investing.
1. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) is a classic, and for good reason. The ETF tracks the performance of the S&P 500 stock index, which tracks the stock performance of roughly 500 of the largest public companies traded in the U.S. (as ranked by market capitalization (market cap)). When investors talk about the performance of the stock market, they are quite often referring to the performance of the S&P 500 index.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has generated strong returns over the years. Over the past decade, the ETF has had an average annual return of 13.3% (as of the end of September 2024). Over the past five years, it's been even stronger, up an average of 15.9%. Meanwhile, the ETF is up nearly 20% year to date.
VOO Chart
While investors may fret about investing in the ETF with the S&P at all-time highs, they shouldn't. In fact, according to a study from J.P. Morgan, since 1970, investors actually would have seen better returns investing only on days the S&P hit an all-time high compared to any random day.
After one year, investing at all-time highs would result in an average annual return of 9.4% versus 9% on any random day. After two years, investing only on days the S&P 500 hit an all-time high would result in a 20.2% gain versus 18.5% investing on any random day.
This speaks to how bull markets tend to last much longer than bear markets, with the medium bull market lasting three times longer than the average bear market.
An S&P 500 ETF should be a core holding in any investor's portfolio, and the Vanguard ETF is a great option with a minuscule expense ratio of 0.03%, meaning investors get to keep virtually all their gains with little payment going to the fund.

2. Invesco QQQ ETF
Technology continues to change the world, so perhaps it is not surprising that many of the world's largest companies today come from the tech sector. As such, I think it is a good idea to add a little more tech exposure to one's portfolio.
One way to do that is with the Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq-100 index. This is a very tech-heavy weighted index, with nearly 65% of its portfolio in the tech sector and over 13% in consumer discretionary stocks, which include some pretty tech-adjacent names, such as Amazon and Tesla.

QQQ,2024-10-03,Why Gen Z bets big while boomers play it safe: A generational breakdown of market returns,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gen-z-bets-big-while-boomers-play-it-safe-a-generational-breakdown-of-market-returns-163139081.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
It's a Goldilocks moment for investors.
As the books are closed on September, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has delivered a solid 20% return so far this year. Meanwhile, bonds are up a respectable 4.7%. And cash is yielding a similar percentage return — even after the Fed began cutting rates a few weeks ago.
But new research from Jack Manley at JPMorgan Asset Management uncovers hidden pitfalls, particularly for those entering their investment years during periods of high cash yields (much like the present). His findings suggest that all investors, regardless of generation, are heavily shaped by the market environment they grew up in.
Manley's methodology, rooted in demographic and behavioral analysis, assumes individuals begin investing 20 years after their generation's inception. For example, baby boomers started investing around 1966, Gen X in 1985, millennials in 2001, and Gen Z in 2017.
Source: FactSet, Robert Shiller, JPMorgan Asset Management. *Investment periods begin 20 years after each generation's inception based on the assumption that people have access to investable capital at this age. Investment periods begin in the following years: Baby Boomer (1966), Generation X (1985), Millennials (2001), Generation Z (2017). Annualized total returns are calculated using monthly data as of March 31, 2024. Data are as of June 30, 2024.
Over the decades, boomers have weathered all sorts of market turmoil, from the inflation crises of the 1970s to multiple tech booms later in life. With average annual stock returns around 10.2% and bond returns of 6.2%, their experience reflects a period of high growth and volatility.
As Manley explained in an episode of Stocks in Translation, “the Fed paid pathological attention” to the inflation crisis, and the entire experience had a profound effect in shaping boomers' cautious and diversified approach to investing — despite the strong returns.
For Generation X, the journey has been one of boom-bust cycles. But the older cohort of this group largely began investing amid a secular boom in markets. Entering adulthood during the 1980s, they witnessed the rise of tech but also faced brutal recessions, from the dot-com bubble to the 2008 financial crisis.
With returns hovering around 11.6% for stocks, their approach is cautious but optimistic. As Manley noted about the current market environment, “strong balance sheets are very important right now.” This may resonate with Gen X’s preference for financial resilience in uncertain times.
Millennials are the most educated generation, as measured by the percentage with bachelor's degrees or higher. But they have not fared as well in stock market returns, averaging around 8.0%, according to Manley.
When millennials came of investing age in 2001, the S&P 500 peaked, ushering in the dot-com bust. After stocks roared back amid a housing boom, the global financial crisis created a double top in the benchmark in 2007 that would not be eclipsed until 2013 — leaving millennial investors underwater for a dozen years.

Economic data releases and earnings
Risk markets are off to an ominous start this October.
After a blistering rally over the first nine months that led the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to its best performance since 1997, the benchmark just had its worst day in three weeks on Tuesday.
Geopolitical tensions and an Iranian missile strike on Israel are dominating headlines, pushing crude oil prices higher as fears of supply disruptions escalate. The first strike by the International Longshoremen's Association since 1977 — threatening supply chains once again and potentially shuttering ports from Houston to Boston — isn't helping.
But there’s another key driver adding structural bullishness to commodities: China’s largest stimulus package since the pandemic, with the promise of more to come.

Last week, China unleashed a suite of monetary and fiscal easing measures, catapulting China's benchmark CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) 27% from its September lows into fresh bull market territory.
New support for China's beleaguered housing market this week adds to prior measures — including support for Chinese-listed stocks — which all told now total over $500 billion (though estimates vary widely).
These aggressive actions are already reverberating through global commodity markets. Iron ore futures have surged over 20% in China, leading Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, to weigh in on X:
""The Chinese finally stimulating domestic demand gives hope that they will start to consume more. This idea is significantly contributing to this unfolding rally in industrial metals.""
Connecting the dots, it's a short trip to higher energy prices. As Bianco notes, ""The Chinese consume more energy than the US or the EU.""
Institutional investors have been caught flat-footed all around. According to the BofA September Global Fund Manager Survey, China's growth expectations had fallen to a record low. Any shorts have likely been sent scrambling.
Meanwhile, WTI (WTI) and Brent (BZ=F) crude oil are surging with Iran's missile attack on Israel, with the former jumping nearly 8% Tuesday.

QQQ,2024-10-01,Here's how AI is set to disrupt healthcare — albeit slowly,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
The third quarter just wrapped, and the pure AI trade of Nvidia (NVDA) and its chip cohorts suddenly finds itself a net drag on overall S&P 500 performance — which itself surprised investors with a solid 5.5% return.
Nevertheless, generative AI is still hot and slowly moving into real-world applications.
Abby Yoder, US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, highlighted that healthcare, which is notoriously slow-moving, may be an upcoming candidate for AI-driven innovation.
""Healthcare has underperformed seven of the last eight years,"" Yoder pointed out in a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, despite the sector being the only one in the S&P 500 to boast positive annual earnings growth over the past 21 years.
But Yoder sees AI as a potential key to unlock a long-awaited shake-up that could bring long-term growth back to the sector.
Healthcare stocks have struggled in recent years, a trend Yoder attributes to legacy constraints of old systems and obstacles that make it difficult for new technologies to take root. The byzantine web of players, rules, regulators, and more has so far prevented significant AI adoption, which has the potential to address inefficiencies in insurance approvals, manual record-keeping, and claims management, all of which drag on productivity.

There are some ripples of change, however. Companies like Google and Microsoft are diving into this space, partnering with hospitals and startups to create AI tools that lighten this burden.
On the diagnostic side, AI is being used to streamline medical imaging, cutting down time for tasks like identifying patterns in medical data, which improves both speed and accuracy in patient care. The goal is not to rid the world of human radiologists and technicians, but empower them with 21st-century tools that lighten their load and accelerate patient diagnoses and recoveries.
AI proponents say it's not just about cutting costs; it’s about revolutionizing patient care. By using vast datasets of clinical information, the promise of AI is to someday help predict patient outcomes more effectively, modeling care before it happens to anticipate complications and select treatments.
The other great hope for medical AI bulls is the immense promise for drug discovery.
According to Morgan Stanley's healthcare forecast, the company's head of US biopharma research Terence Flynn estimates that “[every] 2.5% improvement in preclinical development success rates could lead to an additional 30-plus new drug approvals over 10 years,"" which would represent around $70 billion.

QQQ,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

QQQ,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

QQQ,2024-09-26,Advisors' Surging ETF Use Led by Active Funds: Fidelity,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advisors-surging-etf-led-active-180327808.html,"Financial advisors continue buying ETFs for their clients in increasing numbers, according to a recent Fidelity survey that found gains largely coming from purchases of more expensive actively managed funds as opposed to passive funds that generally track an index.
Purchases of active exchange-traded funds more than doubled among financial advisors since 2022, the Fidelity Institutional report on portfolio construction trends found. Based on over 3,000 professionally managed investment portfolios reviewed in the second quarter, the report states that 29% of advisors now have allocations to actively managed ETFs, up from 13% in 2022.
Among advisors using active ETFs, the average allocation is 17%, Fidelity’s analysis shows, with a particular focus on fixed income.
Active ETF Growth Driven by Fixed Income
Fidelity attributes the growing popularity of ETFs to advantages such as better tax efficiency, lower costs, and intraday liquidity compared to other investment vehicles. The report shows that 68% of incoming portfolios utilize both mutual funds and ETFs, while 74% of target portfolios include both vehicles.
Index funds remain the most popular product among advisors, especially for domestic equities, according to Fidelity's data.
The average portfolio reviewed contains 13 holdings from 6 different asset managers, with underlying blended fees of 50 basis points, the report notes.
Fidelity’s analysis reveals that 24% of portfolios with large-cap exposure utilize only passive products, which could lead to unintended concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks.
The report indicates that advisors have been reallocating from fixed income to equities to take on risk and participate in the market.
Fixed income allocations remained at 29%, the lowest in 2 years, according to Fidelity's data.
While investment grade allocations were at a two-year high last quarter, they have dropped to 80% in the second quarter, the report shows.
In the equity space, the report revealed that the average equity sleeve of a portfolio was 68% in the second quarter.
Seventy-nine percent of the equity sleeve is allocated to U.S. equities versus 21% in international, Fidelity’s analysis shows.
Within U.S. equity, the average portfolio has 66% allocated to large-cap, 22% to mid-caps and 12% to small caps, which is largely unchanged from previous quarters, according to the report.
Fidelity’s data indicates that advisors continued to increase their allocation to sensitive sectors—including communication services and technology—along with growth allocation.

China just announced its biggest economic stimulus since the pandemic, which is reverberating in stocks and commodities worldwide.
After the details of the monetary stimulus and support for the stock market were announced Tuesday by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's benchmark index, the CSI 300 (000300.SS), surged 4.3% — its largest jump since July 2020.
The country's currency, the renminbi (CNH=X), dropped 0.6% — the most since the Japanese yen imploded in early August.
In the US, stocks rose, but the biggest effect was felt in commodities. Silver futures (SI=F) skyrocketed over 4.5% to a decade-plus high. Copper futures (HG=F) — already on a nine-day tear — notched a 10th straight win as it surged to a two-month high.

For banks, the PBOC cut the amount of money required to set aside for loans — the reserve requirement ratio — by half a percentage point, freeing up about $142 billion in short-term liquidity.
The plan also lowers short- to medium-term interest rates and makes mortgage relief a top priority.
According to PBOC governor Pan Gongsheng, these moves will benefit around 50 million households, saving them $21.3 billion annually in interest expenses.
For China's ailing stock market (the CSI is down 40% from its 2021 peak), a $71 billion stock market stabilization program was introduced to allow securities firms, funds, and insurers to access funding for stock purchases through a swap facility.
But before investors start celebrating, it's helpful to know that China’s track record with these big stimulus pushes has been mixed to poor.
In 2008, the country's massive infrastructure spending led to unsustainable debt. Fast-forward to 2015, and a stock market crash wiped out gains despite similar interventions. And during the pandemic, the Chinese property sector collapsed after another stimulus effort fueled a bubble.
The question on everyone’s mind: Will China add fiscal stimulus to that record?

If Beijing starts throwing more government money at the problem, particularly for infrastructure, that could have global ripple effects.
Commodities would likely see another big push, impacting everything from US manufacturing to energy sectors. There could be major shifts in supply chains and pricing for raw materials (yes, again).

QQQ,2024-09-24,Pacer ETF Bets on Nasdaq 100 Dividend Yield,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pacer-etf-bets-nasdaq-100-214842711.html,"Most investors probably don’t buy the growth-oriented Nasdaq 100 Index for the dividend income, but the latest strategy from Pacer ETFs is designed to change that.
The Pacer Metaurus Nasdaq-100 Dividend Multiplier 600 ETF (QSIX) offers six times the dividend yield of the underlying index, which currently adds up to 4.2%.
That is not a bad yield, especially when coupled with the potential growth of the index.
The dividend boost is accomplished through the purchase of futures contracts going out over the next four years. And in exchange for that extra dividend yield, the QSIX only tracks about 85% of the underlying index, which means a slight lag in growth.
Sean O’Hara, president of Pacer ETFs in Malvern, Pa., said the tradeoff is more than worth it.
“We’re basically deconstructing the price return and the dividend return, and when we put it back together the equity return is lower, but the dividend return is higher,” he said.
With fewer than half the companies in the Nasdaq 100 currently paying a dividend, O’Hara acknowledged that this is not normally the place investors would turn for dividend income.
Will Fast-Growing Companies Pivot to Dividends?
However, he is betting on the fastest-growing companies in the index turning to dividends at some point in the next few years in order to offload some of the cash on their balance sheets.
The ETF’s current formula uses 15% of the index’s beta as collateral to acquire the futures contracts over the next four years to replicate 600% of the annual dividend yield of the Nasdaq 100.
O’Hara believes that alone should be enough to attract investors eager for dividend yield and satisfied with 85% of the equity performance.
But what O’Hara said isn’t factored into the price he’s paying for the dividend futures contracts is the probability of cash-rich non-dividend-payers introducing dividends.
“That is not currently in the dividends futures price, and I think it’s one of the more valuable pieces of QSIX,” he said.
Pacer, which manages nearly $47 billion across 55 ETFs, already has a track record with the strategy through the Pacer Metaurus US Large Cap Dividend Multiplier 400 ETF (QDPL), which offers 400% of the dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index.
etf.com
Introduced in July 2021, QDPL has grown to more than $500 million.
“We had some success with QDPL, and we thought, ‘where else can we do this?’” O’Hara said.

QQQ,2024-09-23,Data shows US economy pacing for 'healthy' growth — but new 'headwinds' loom,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/data-shows-us-economy-pacing-for-healthy-growth--but-new-headwinds-loom-145041536.html,"The US economy appears on track for another solid quarter of growth, new data showed Monday, while also pointing to potential ""headwinds"" in the manufacturing sector and with price pressures.
S&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, came in at 54.4 in September, down from 54.6 in August. Economists had expected the index to tick down to 54.3.
Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the data shows the US economy is pacing for ""healthy"" growth in the third quarter, which will come to a close at the end of September.
“The sustained robust expansion of output signaled by the PMI in September is consistent with a healthy annualized rate of GDP growth of 2.2% in the third quarter,"" Williamson said in the release.
After a better-than-expected update on retail sales in August, economists have been expecting a solid third quarter of growth for the US economy. As of Sept. 18, the Goldman Sachs economics team had been tracking third quarter GDP at 3%, while the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool saw 2.9% annualized growth.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week also cited the still-healthy economy as a reason to cut interest rates and not get behind the curve.
""The US economy is in good shape,"" Powell said. ""It's growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down. The labor market is in a strong pace. We want to keep it there.""
There were some signs of slowing within Monday's S&P Global data, however.
The services component of S&P's report showed the index registered 55.4 this month, down from 55.7 in August. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity continued to lag, falling to a 15-month low of 47 from 47.9 the month prior.
Any reading above 50 for these indexes represents expansion in the sector; readings below 50 indicate contraction. Additionally, prices charged rose at the fastest rate in six months, which Williamson noted could be cause for concern on the inflation front.
“The early survey indicators for September point to an economy that continues to grow at a solid pace, albeit with a weakened manufacturing sector and intensifying political uncertainty acting as substantial headwinds,"" Williamson said. ""A reacceleration of inflation is meanwhile also signaled, suggesting the Fed cannot totally shift its focus away from its inflation target as it seeks to sustain the economic upturn.""

Don't believe it? Read further to discover the secrets of how consistent savings and long-term stock market returns can add up to a half-million bucks.
Image source: Getty Images.
Getting started
First things first: In order to grow a nest egg, you must save. So, let's imagine a hypothetical investor who has it within their means to save $500 per month.
Next, let's imagine a base case where our hypothetical investor poured this $500 per month into a five-year certificate of deposit (CD) that paid 5% annually. Furthermore, let's also assume that our hypothetical investor could roll their nest egg every five years into a new CD with the same 5% annual rate.
Time Period
Value of Nest Egg
Year 5
$33,907
Year 10
$77,182
Year 20
$202,902
Year 25
$292,867
Calculations by author.
As you can see, after five years, our investor's nest egg will have grown to nearly $34,000. In 10 years, it would be worth more than $77,000. And in 25 years, their nest egg will have grown to almost $300,000.
Not bad. But the stock market can put those 5% annual returns to shame. Here's how.
How to use a basic index fund to grow a nest egg
Let's start by identifying a simple, well-known index exchange-traded fund. I like the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ). It's chock-full of technology stocks like Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia. It also offers some diversification. It has holdings in PepsiCo, Amgen, Costco Wholesale, Starbucks, and CSX, to name just a few.
At any rate, what's of particular interest is the fund's annual returns. Because over the last 10 years, this fund has generated a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.2%.
QQQ Total Return Level Chart
Granted, the last 10 years have been excellent for the stock market -- and for tech stocks in particular. So, if we extend the performance window back to 1999, giving us 25 years of data, the fund's CAGR slips to 9.1%.
QQQ Total Return Level Chart
To be conservative, let's use this lower CAGR of 9.1% and see how 25 years of investing could help our hypothetical investor turn $500 into $500,000.
How stock market returns measure up
By applying a 9.1% CAGR to the nest egg, we begin to see how a seemingly small change in annual return can truly ramp up investment returns.
Time Period
Value of Nest Egg (9.1% CAGR)
Value of Nest Egg (5% CAGR)
Year 5
$37,457
$33,907
Year 10
$95,354
$77,182
Year 20
$323,171
$202,902
Year 25
$536,981
$292,867
Calculations by author.
At first, the difference is small -- almost imperceptible. Five years in, the investment nest egg has only generated about $3,500 more.

September’s triple witching comes the same week as the Federal Reserve kicks off its rate-cutting cycle and a rebalancing of the S&P 500 (^GSPC).
eToro US investment and options analyst Bret Kenwell joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the options playbook after the big day for options traders.
“Today was one of the four big expiration dates of the year when it comes to the options market, and you saw that action leading up to today's session with so much back and forth,"" Kenwell tells Yahoo Finance.
“We had a late day pop in stocks, and a lot of that plays into the expiration, but I think what's really interesting is when you look at the seasonality in September, it tends to be pretty bad for US stocks, and when you really dial into that seasonality, you see a lot of it comes in the so-called back half of mid-month…so that leaves the door open at least to see some choppiness, some profit taking, or some outright seasonal weakness kind of going into the end of the quarter.”

Kenwell says he’s expecting strength in the tech sector after “tech has sort of fallen by the wayside amid all this, you know, breadth expansion...suddenly it's gone from the favorite stocks, the leadership group to being, I think it's the fourth or fifth best performer of the year.”
Kenwell says there were “a lot of put sales into some of the Magnificent Seven names or a lot of the semiconductor leaders” during downturns earlier in the month. He adds “I don't know that that's necessarily the best way for a retail investor to play. It's probably a more reasonable way to play at this point would be by either buying calls or if they wanted to reduce that cost and limit their upside a bit. Call spread would be a great way to get into it.”

QQQ,2024-09-20,SPY's Big Outflows Hamper State Street: Morningstar,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spys-big-outflows-hamper-state-192918929.html,"In the race for ETF supremacy, third-place State Street Global Advisors is being hamstrung this year by its flagship fund, the $558 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).
The world's first and largest exchange-traded fund has bled a net $26.9 billion so far this year, pinching State Street's overall flows and widening its standings in the league tables behind larger rivals, No. 1 BlackRock Inc. and No. 2 Vanguard Group.
According to the latest data from Morningstar, SSGA’s net ETF inflows this year through August totaled $8.1 billion, including net outflows of $3.9 billion for U.S. equity ETFs and $300 million for municipal bond ETFs. BlackRock's iShares took in $145.5 billion over the same period while Vanguard led all firms with a $174.8 billion haul.
""Recent flows have been shaky for State Street Global Advisors,"" the Morningstar report said. ""Whiplash flows to and from SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF SPY and tepid interest in sector equity ETFs have weighed on State Street’s bottom line, too.
At more than $3 trillion across 414 ETFs, iShares is the largest issuer, followed by Vanguard with $2.6 trillion across 86 ETFs. SSGA has $1.3 trillion under management across 137 ETFs.
Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, took issue with the Morningstar data, claiming it as “a little bit of an incomplete report.”
“There are seasonality and structural trends that typically drive flows into SPY in the November and December timeframe,” he said, adding that the ETF took in “$50 billion last year during those two months.”
SPY a ""Unicorn""
“SPY has the fourth-most flows of any ETF, and it is a unicorn; a legit one of one,” he added. Bartolini said SPY’s size and liquidity has established it as a “very diverse use case, related to optionality and derivatives trading.”
“SPY trades roughly $25 billion a day,” he said. “No other ETF has ever come close to it, nor ever will.”
Ryan Jackson, senior manager research analyst at Morningstar, confirmed that “SPY has definitely seen better inflows and asset growth at the end of the year.”
According to Morningstar, from 2014 through 2023, SPY’s average fourth-quarter net inflow was $16 billion.
Jackson acknowledged the variability of flows into SPY as a unique trading vehicle, but said SSGA is also losing ground to iShares and Vanguard due to a smaller footprint in the increasingly popular categories of fixed income and actively managed ETFs.
Worst Year Since 2018?
On that point, Bartolini responded that, “Our fixed income lineup is pretty broad based and our active lineup, which is more in the fixed income arena, covers core and core plus.”

QQQ,2024-09-20,"Forget Nvidia: This Top ETF Could Turn $25,000 Into Over $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-top-etf-could-082700541.html,"Nvidia is a stock that's been synonymous with generating high-powered returns in recent years. The chipmaker is a big player in the artificial intelligence market, as its chips are the go-to option for many tech companies building out their chatbots and other next-gen products. But Nvidia also isn't a cheap investment -- its market cap is around $3 trillion. Trying to earn a high return with a stock that's already one of the most valuable companies in the world won't be easy, especially with expectations being so high for the business at this point.
If you want to earn a big return and turn $25,000 into more than $1 million, there is a safer and better way to do so -- assuming that you're willing to be patient. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) can allow you to generate some massive gains over the years, while also allowing you to keep your risk fairly low. You won't be overly exposed to just a single stock, the way you would be if you only bought shares of Nvidia.
An ETF that can be ideal for growth investors is the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ). Here's why it can be a no-brainer buy.
The Invesco fund gives investors broad diversification in many growth stocks
If you want exposure to the top growth stocks in the world, odds are you'll look to the Nasdaq exchange, where many top tech stocks trade. The Invesco fund will narrow the list even further, however, giving you exposure to just the top 100 non-financial stocks on the exchange. This means you'll avoid some of the riskier stocks on the Nasdaq. Instead, you'll get access to some of the best and brightest growth stocks in the world.
Nvidia is one of the top holdings in the ETF, but it only accounts for 8% of its total weight. The ETF also holds shares of Costco Wholesale, Alphabet, Amazon, and many other big-name stocks. Although it's heavily skewed toward tech stocks (they account for half of the fund), other sectors of the market are represented in the fund as well, including healthcare, industrials, and consumer discretionary stocks. Collectively, these stocks can help you generate strong and steady returns over the years.
How the ETF can help grow your portfolio to $1 million
For a $25,000 investment to turn into $1 million or more, it will need to grow to 40 times its original value. To accumulate that kind of return, you'll want to focus on the long term, such as a period of 25 to 30 years. That way, you aren't setting your expectations too high or focusing on risky small-cap stocks that may appear to have a lot of upside.
Over a period of 25 years, you would need to average a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15.9% for an investment to grow to 40x its original value. But if you're able to remain invested for 30 years, the necessary CAGR falls to 13.1%.
Historically, the Invesco ETF has been a strong investment to hang on to. When including dividends, its total returns over the past decade have totaled 417%, which equates to a CAGR of 17.9%. That doesn't, of course, mean that it will generate those types of returns over the next couple of decades, but it's indicative of the strength of the growth stocks it possesses in its portfolio, and their ability to generate massive returns. Even at a slower growth rate, the fund has the potential to make you a millionaire with a $25,000 investment, as long as you're willing to be patient and hang on for the long haul.
The Invesco QQQ Trust makes for a great option for any investor
Whether you track growth stocks or just want a diversified portfolio, the QQQ fund can be a great investment to add to your own holdings. It has a fairly low expense ratio of 0.2%, and with exposure to top growth stocks, it's a no-brainer investment that can be suitable for just about any type of investor. It can also be a great default investment to put money into, especially if you don't want to have to track individual stocks.

QQQ,2024-09-19,SEC Updates Rules for $55T Equity Markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-updates-rules-55t-equity-192427638.html,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved updates to rules governing the $55 trillion equity markets, SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced in a statement on Wednesday.
These changes are designed to “enhance competition, efficiency, and fairness, benefitting investors and capital formation alike,” Powell said.
The updates come nearly two decades after the last comprehensive review of national market system rules in 2005, the statement noted. The changes come as transaction volume in listed equities has doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17 years, data in the statement showed.
""There's been a significant increase in everyday investor participation in the markets,"" Gensler said in a statement, adding that 58% of American households own stocks.
Key changes include relaxing the one-penny minimum quotation increment to half a penny for many stocks.
This reduction in “tick size” will allow stocks to be priced more efficiently and competitively, potentially lowering costs for investors and improving liquidity, the SEC explained.
Lowering Exchanges' Maximum Fees
The new rules also lower the maximum fee that exchanges can charge for accessing the best bid or offer from three-tenths of a penny to one-tenth of a penny.
This change addresses concerns raised by market participants about price transparency, market complexity and potential conflicts of interest, Gensler’s statement said.
Additionally, the updated rules implement a new definition of a round lot, replacing the 120-year-old standard of 100 shares.
The new definition introduces a tiered system (100, 40, 10, or 1 share) based on share price, which could lead to better pricing for investors, according to the announcement.
The reforms also aim to provide greater transparency on quotes for orders smaller than a round lot, known as “odd lots,” the SEC disclosed.
The SEC chair highlighted that approximately 74% of share volume is currently being quoted at less than 1.5 pennies, up from 54% in 2005.
Gensler said that these reforms “will help promote greater transparency, competition, fairness, and efficiency in our $55 trillion equity markets.”

Instead, Fed Chair Powell appears to have convinced investors the central bank is cutting rates to keep the economy on track, not to save it. Stocks surged Thursday following Powell's press conference after the rate cut decision.

""Chair Powell had one job at his post-FOMC press conference today: convince markets that a 50 bp cut was consistent with a thoughtful policy adjustment rather than a sign that the Fed is worried it is behind the curve,"" DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. ""He accomplished that goal ... This is consistent with prior mid-cycle markets, where equities can continue to rally.""
Investors had been increasingly expecting a soft landing, where the Fed's aggressive tightening cycle ends with inflation falling to the 2% target without a significant downturn in the economy. On Wednesday, Chair Powell reiterated that scenario remains in play.
Powell remarked the US economy is ""in good shape."" He pointed out that risks to further cooling in the labor market have risen. But the Fed is cutting with that in mind.
""The labor market is actually in solid condition,"" he said. ""And our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.""
To Colas, the comments change little about the market narrative.
""[The Fed] decision doesn’t actually change very much about the current market setup,"" Colas wrote. ""We know that rates are coming down. We know that the US economy is in reasonably good shape. We know the labor market is cooling but not yet tipping over. While the Fed may have been somewhat clumsy in how it conditioned markets to expect today’s decision, that’s now in the past.""
In the day following Chair Powell's press conference, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rushed to new record highs, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose over 2%.
Markets are showing familiar price action too, with the largest tech stocks leading the charge higher on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) all rose just under 4%. The Information Technology sector (XLK) as a whole rose just under 3%, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.7% gain.
Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert described the rotation into large-cap tech on Thursday as ""a catch-up move"" into a section of the market that will likely benefit from interest rate cuts but hadn't been leading the rally since the S&P 500's last record close on July 16.

QQQ,2024-09-18,ETFs' Drain on Mutual Funds Shows No Sign of Slowing,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etfs-drain-mutual-funds-shows-200430364.html,"Exchange-traded funds continue to gobble up market share from mutual funds, according to the latest report from Morningstar.
Investors poured a net $69.3 billion into ETFs while pulling $43.2 billion from mutual funds. That continues a longer-term trend, including the first eight months of the year, in which ETFs raked in $588.1 billion and mutual funds bled $217 billion, the report said.
In terms of where the money is going, the data show a growing appeal for fixed income in August as the financial markets braced for the first interest cut by the Federal Reserve in more than four years.
According to the Morningstar report, active and passive taxable bond mutual funds and ETFs combined for $33 billion worth of net inflows in August, effectively carrying mutual fund and ETF inflows to $26 billion in August.
While U.S. equity fund inflows were essentially flat during the month, international equity funds recorded their worst month of the year in terms of asset flows, with approximately $8 billion moving out the door in August.
Municipal bond funds also had a strong month, taking in $5.54 billion and marking the first time more than $5 billion flowed into the funds in consecutive months in three years.
On a year-to-date basis through August, No. 2 issuer Vanguard Group is leading with $174.8 billion in net inflows, followed by BlackRock's iShares, as the No. 1 issuer has hauled in $145.5 billion. State Street, issuer of the SPDR funds and the third-largest ETF manager, has brought in $8.1 billion this year.
Ryan Jackson, senior manager research analyst at Morningstar, attributed the State Street’s woes to a combination of factors, including “the variability of flows into and out of” the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).
Other factors hampering State Street when competing against the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard, Jackson added is the smaller bond ETF footprint at a time when bond ETFs are gaining appeal and a fewer active ETFs.

SPHD,2024-09-05,Market Rotation Fuels Diverse ETF Outperformance in August,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-rotation-fuels-diverse-etf-223451834.html,"A diverse mix of ETFs outperformed in August, reflecting a potential shift in investor sentiment and market dynamics.
According to data from Morningstar Direct, the top-performing ETFs for the month included strategies focused on dividends, value, and low volatility, alongside some momentum plays.
Rob Isbitts, founder of research firm Sungarden Investment Publishing and an etf.com contributor, described August as “a tale of three parts” that contributed to the eclectic mix of top performers.
“There was that sudden drop in the first couple days of the month, which probably was a shock,” Isbitts said. “And then you had this knee-jerk, instant reaction.”
He noted that from Aug. 5 to Aug. 19, the S&P 500 rose about 8% in just two weeks, an unusually strong move. This volatility created opportunities for various strategies to outperform.
Dividend, Low Volatility Strategies Lead
Several top-performing ETFs focused on high dividend or low volatility strategies. The $6.6 billion SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD) gained 4.5% in August, according to Morningstar Direct. It was joined by the $4 billion Invesco S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (SPHD), which returned 4.8% for the month.
“People were either going for yield, or they were going for value, or they were going for both,” Isbitts said, explaining the appeal of these strategies. “There were three factors: dividend was one, value was another, low volatility was another.”
Morningstar Direct data shows that the $802 million SPDR SSGA U.S. Large Cap Low Volatility Index ETF (LGLV) also made the top 10 list, returning 4.5% in August, further highlighting the strong performance of low volatility strategies.
Despite the shift toward defensive strategies, momentum-based ETFs also performed well. The SPDR SSGA U.S. Large Cap Low Volatility Index ETF (SEIM) led with a 5.5% return in August, Morningstar Direct reported.
“I believe it was a little bit of a happy medium,” Isbitts said, suggesting this performance might be due to a more balanced approach. “That’s the thing with ETFs. We said, okay, we're going to use a momentum factor. It kind of means you’re chasing the past, and it works.”
SEIM vs SPY Performance
The $280 million Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (GVIP), which tracks popular hedge fund holdings, also made the top 10 list, returning 4.4% in August, according to Morningstar Direct.
Other notable performers include the $271 million ETC 6 Meridian Mega Cap Equity ETF (SIXA) and the $804 million ALPS O’Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (OUSA), which gained 4.2% and 3.95% respectively.

SPXL,2024-08-30,Worry more about the AI bubble burst than US recession: strategists,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worry-more-ai-bubble-burst-134039564.html,"Investing.com -- Investors should be more concerned about the potential burst of the AI bubble than a looming U.S. or global recession, according to strategists at BCA Research.
The firm's analysis warns that the risks associated with the booming AI sector outweigh those posed by broader economic downturns.
""When bubbles burst, the investment priority is to steer well clear of the bursting bubble plus sectors, regions, and countries heavily exposed to it,"" BCA Research emphasized.
This means that whether or not a recession follows the bubble's collapse, the focus should be on avoiding areas most affected by the fallout.
On a cyclical 6-12 month horizon, BCA Research says there are several key strategies to mitigate risk.
First, they recommend staying overweight in bonds and the Japanese yen (JPY), which are traditionally seen as safer havens during periods of market turbulence.
Conversely, investors should underweight U.S. tech and quasi-tech sectors, which are most closely tied to the AI boom, and reduce exposure to U.S. equities in a global portfolio.
""Tactically, SGD/USD is vulnerable to reversal,"" the note adds, suggesting caution for those involved in the Singapore dollar and U.S. dollar currency pair.
Additionally, BCA Research sees a ""long copper versus gold"" strategy as a viable countertrend trade, potentially offering a hedge against the broader market risks.
The overarching message from BCA Research is: ""Investors should worry much less about a U.S. or global recession than they should worry about the bubble in anything AI-related.""
As the AI sector continues to draw immense attention and capital, BCA believes the potential for a sharp correction poses a significant threat, making it a critical factor for investors to consider.

SPXL,2024-08-26,BCA assigns 55% chance that Trump will win the presidency in November,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bca-assigns-55-chance-trump-144648323.html,"BCA Research has assigned a 55% probability that Donald Trump will win the U.S. presidency in the upcoming November election, marking a contrarian stance compared to other forecasts.
The outlook is rooted in BCA’s analysis of the current political and economic landscape, where they believe that Trump's potential victory could lead to a full Republican sweep of both the White House and Congress. This scenario, though contested, remains BCA's “most likely” outcome.
The 55% probability marks a slight downgrade from an earlier 60% estimate, yet Trump remains the favored candidate in this closely contested race, according to the investment research firm.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who has recently taken over as the Democratic nominee, also presents a strong challenge, buoyed by her status as part of the incumbent party. However, BCA points out that Harris is statistically tied with Trump in key swing states, and factors such as rising unemployment and weaker polling among key demographics may hinder her chances.
“The loss of an incumbent president advantage with Biden dropping out, the uptick in unemployment in contested states, and the lackluster polling among key demographics, lead us to maintain our view of a Trump victory in the White House, though we downgrade his odds to 55% from 60%,” BCA strategists note.
The firm also breaks down the likelihood of various election outcomes. Within the 55% chance of a Trump victory, they assign a 50% probability to a full Republican sweep – control of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives – and a 5% chance of Trump winning the presidency with a mixed Congress.
In contrast, if Harris were to win, BCA sees a 45% probability, with a higher likelihood of a Republican or mixed Congress rather than a Democratic sweep.
Should Trump win, strategists anticipate notable economic and sectoral impacts. Trump's policies, characterized by fiscal stimulus and deregulation, are expected to be inflationary, leading to higher budget deficits and long-term inflation.
Sectors that would benefit under a Trump administration include Energy, Financials, Industrials, Materials, and Real Estate, all of which are tied to his proposed policies such as increasing domestic energy production and infrastructure investments.
On the other hand, defensive sectors like Health Care and Utilities are highlighted by BCA as prudent choices for investors, given the expected near-term economic slowdown and market volatility leading up to and following the election.
BCA stresses that regardless of the election outcome, these sectors offer downside protection and are likely to outperform in the current uncertain environment.

SPXL,2024-08-26,Powell’s latest pivot won’t be his last,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-latest-pivot-won-t-090520027.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday marked a significant dovish shift in the central bank’s stance on monetary policy.
Powell signaled that the Fed is now prepared to lower interest rates, aligning with market expectations for a series of rate cuts. His remarks suggest that the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment is increasingly skewed towards supporting the labor market, even as inflation trends towards the Fed's 2% target.
During the speech, Powell did not push back against market expectations of multiple rate cuts.
“The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” he said.
While he was not more dovish than the market, Powell “didn’t utter any hawkish views whatsoever to alter the market’s dovish expectations for several rate cuts,” strategists at Yardeni Research said in a note.
The federal funds rate (FFR) futures market currently indicates a total of 100 basis points in cuts, bringing the rate down to 4.25% by year-end. Projections suggest the FFR could decrease further to 3.00% by the end of next year.
However, Yardeni strategists believe Powell’s comments on Friday may have been “overly” dovish, and that his latest pivot “won’t be his last.”
They note that while inflation has been trending downwards, it may not be wise to ease policy too quickly, especially with the labor market remaining relatively strong.
Powell’s emphasized that “upside risks to inflation have diminished,” while “the downside risks to employment have increased.” This reflects the Fed's view that the labor market, which has cooled from its previously overheated state, is now a greater concern than the possibility of inflation reaccelerating.
But should inflationary pressures resurface, it could leave the Fed vulnerable, according to Yardeni.
The strategists point out that just a month ago, Powell was emphasizing the need to maintain a restrictive policy stance to keep demand in line with supply and to manage inflationary pressures.
At that time, Powell mentioned the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment repeatedly, indicating a balanced approach. In contrast, at Jackson Hole, Powell mentioned the mandate only twice, placing greater emphasis on the need to support the labor market.
However, that stance could require yet another pivot from Powell and the Fed if economic conditions change again, Yardeni strategists cautioned.

SPXL,2024-08-21,Jackson Hole Preview: Q&A on the Fed’s annual conference,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jackson-hole-preview-q-fed-092701390.html,"The Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole conference, scheduled for later this week, will be closely watched by markets as policymakers gather to discuss the effectiveness and transmission of monetary policy. Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday morning will be the main focus.
In a Tuesday note, Goldman Sachs released a Q&A outlining key expectations and insights from the upcoming conference.
Q: ‘What is the agenda for the Fed’s Jackson Hole conference?’
The theme for this year’s Jackson Hole conference is ""Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,” and Chair Powell's speech at 10 AM New York time on Friday will be the highlight, Goldman notes.
The conference will also feature research presentations and speeches from other policymakers on Friday and Saturday. The full agenda will be released on Thursday evening.
Q: ‘What is your current Fed forecast?’
Goldman Sachs forecasts a series of three 25 basis point rate cuts in September, November, and December, with additional quarterly cuts next year, targeting a terminal rate of 3.25-3.5%.
“We think the increase in the unemployment rate to date and other softer signs in the labor market are enough for the FOMC to accelerate the initial pace from the plan implied by the dot plot to cut every other meeting to instead cut at consecutive meetings, but not enough to cut by 50bp,” the bank’s economists said.
However, they acknowledge that a weaker August employment report could prompt a larger cut.
Q: ‘What do you expect Chair Powell to say?’
Goldman economists expect Powell to adopt a slightly more dovish tone compared to the July FOMC meeting, reflecting softer inflation and weaker job growth.
He may express more confidence in the inflation outlook while emphasizing labor market risks, which would likely support expectations of a September rate cut. However, the size of the cut will depend on the upcoming employment data.
Q: ‘Does Jackson Hole matter? Has Powell provided useful monetary policy guidance in the past?’
Powell's Jackson Hole speeches have historically been influential, often providing clear guidance on future Fed policy, Goldman Sachs points out.
For example, his 2020 announcement of flexible average inflation targeting marked a significant shift in monetary policy. His remarks at this year’s conference will also be closely scrutinized.
Q: ‘What are your views on the conference theme, “Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy”?’
Goldman Sachs economists believe that the pandemic has altered the transmission of monetary policy, with factors like resilient risk sentiment and supply constraints muting the impact of rate hikes.

SPXL,2024-08-19,Fed's Kashkari says it is appropriate to debate Sept rate cut: WSJ,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-kashkari-says-appropriate-debate-112311426.html,"Neel Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that he would consider lowering interest rates at the central bank’s upcoming meeting, given the increasing likelihood of a significant weakening in the labor market.
“The balance of risks has shifted, so the debate about potentially cutting rates in September is an appropriate one to have,” Kashkari said in an interview with the WSJ.
Kashkari’s remarks represent a shift from his stance in June, when he suggested that a rate cut might not be necessary until later in the year. The recent increase in the unemployment rate, which rose to 4.3% in July from 3.7% at the beginning of the year, has raised concerns about the potential for an undesirable economic slowdown.
Kashkari noted that if the labor market hadn’t shown signs of weakening—if the unemployment rate had remained between 3.7% and 3.8%—he likely wouldn’t be considering whether to cut rates at this time. However, with progress on inflation and some troubling signs in the labor market, the conversation has changed.
Despite this, the Fed Minneapolis president expressed caution about the size of potential rate cuts, stating that he sees no reason to lower rates by more than a quarter percentage point at a time, given that layoffs remain low and unemployment claims do not signal significant deterioration.
“If we saw some quicker deterioration in the labor market, then that would tell me, ‘Well, we need to do more, quickly, to support the labor market, even if we have uncertainty about where our ultimate destination is going to be,” Kashkari told WSJ.
Until inflation surged to a four-decade high in 2022, Kashkari was one of the Fed’s most dovish officials, prioritizing the labor market over inflation concerns. However, in recent years, he has become one of the more hawkish voices, showing greater concern about inflation risks.
The Fed official remains unconvinced that the current rate levels are as restrictive as some have suggested. He pointed to the low number of layoffs and a resilient housing sector as indicators of this. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that this does not necessarily justify keeping rates unchanged.
“I’m still unclear how tight policy is, but the balance of risks in my view have shifted more towards the labor market and away from the inflation side of our dual mandate,” said Kashkari.

SPXL,2024-08-14,July CPI consistent with 25bp rate cut in September rather than 50bp: strategists,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/july-cpi-consistent-25bp-rate-133151112.html,"The consumer price index (CPI) report for July is “consistent with a 25bp rate cut rather than 50bp,” strategists at Capitol Economics said Wednesday.
All-items CPI rose and core CPI rose 0.15% and 0.18% month-over-month, respectively, in July. This suggests “that the disinflationary trend has firmly reasserted itself, after the temporary relapse in the first quarter,"" Capitol strategists argue.
On an annual basis, the headline CPI rose 2.9% last month, slightly down from the 3.0% rise in June. Economists had anticipated that July's figure would remain consistent with June's rate.
The core CPI, which excludes the more volatile categories such as food and energy, increased by 3.2% over the twelve months leading up to July, coming in just below the expected 3.3%.
This data follows Tuesday’s cooler-than-expected July producer price index (PPI), reinforcing the view that inflationary pressures remain moderate. This could provide the U.S. central bank with room to lower its policy rate, which has been held steady at the 5.25%-5.50% range for over a year.
Based on the latest PPI and CPI data, Capitol Economics estimates that core PCE prices likely increased by 0.17% last month. However, due to unfavorable base effects, this would push the annual core PCE inflation rate up to 2.7% from 2.6%.
They note that the one-month annualized rate would stand at 2.0%, the three-month annualized rate at 2.1%, and the six-month annualized rate would decrease to 2.7% from 3.4%.
""In short, this CPI report represents more good data and adds to the evidence supporting a 25bp September rate cut,"" the strategists remarked.
“Overall, July’s CPI report is probably best described as mildly encouraging – it adds support for a 25bp rate cut in September but, at the same time, doesn’t suggest price pressures are collapsing in a way that could warrant a bigger 50bp reduction.”

SPXL,2024-07-15,Gavekal sees 'a sizable red wave come November’s vote',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gavekal-sees-sizable-red-wave-083800968.html,"Recent political events in the United States, most notably Joe Biden’s surprisingly poor debate performance and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on Saturday, strongly indicate a robust Republican showing in November’s US elections, according to Gavekal Research.
Sixteen weeks is a long time in politics, and much can change before November. However, the 2018 stabbing of Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro demonstrated that “assassination attempts swing undecided voters towards the victim in large numbers,” Gavekal noted.
In the US, more than any other democracy, fundraising plays a crucial role. Following Trump’s conviction on May 31 in a New York court, his campaign saw a surge in donations. After the attempted assassination on Saturday, it is expected that contributions to Trump’s campaign will once again flood in, the macro research firm said in the report.
This influx of support is likely to grow, as the assassination attempt has made it more socially acceptable to support Trump. In 2016, many people were hesitant to openly endorse him. This time, high-profile business figures like Elon Musk and Bill Ackman have publicly pledged their support, and the general public is more openly showing their allegiance.
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party is struggling with internal conflicts and concerns about Joe Biden’s ability to handle a rigorous four-month campaign, leading to a decline in donations. With Hollywood stars increasingly withdrawing their support, backing Biden “has clearly lost its cachet,” Gavekal economists said.
""The prevailing mood has changed, and the stage seems set for a sizable red wave come November’s vote,” they added.
On the positive side for risk assets, this suggests more deregulation, a shift away from diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, more merit-based hiring, and fewer environmental constraints—all factors favored by equity markets. However, it remains uncertain if this will be sufficient to drive another increase in broad indexes, Gavekal said.

SPXL,2024-07-14,"Fed's Powell 'may prefer not to change rates before an election', strategists say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-powell-may-prefer-not-090244070.html,"The softer-than-expected inflation report for June has fueled market expectations of a rate cut by the end of the year, which could occur before the November elections.
This speculation contributed to the US dollar's recent decline and a surge in various market sectors, including bonds, small-cap stocks, and homebuilders.
Gavekal Research's analysis pointed out that the current inflation data is more favorable for rate cuts than it was at the end of last year. As of December, the three-month annualized consumer price index (CPI) was below the Fed's 2% target after adjustments.
Moreover, core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also fell below the target, registering at 1.8% on a three-month adjusted basis.
Gavekal Research noted that if inflation continues to remain low and the Federal Reserve is confident it will stay that way, policy rates are likely to be lowered before 2023 ends, potentially ahead of the elections.
""In an ideal world, Fed chair Jay Powell may prefer not to change rates before an election, but such objections can be overridden by the data,"" the strategists said in a note.
The research firm reflected on the historical precedent of the Federal Reserve altering rates in the months leading up to presidential elections.
Since 1974, during the 10 months preceding the 13 presidential elections, the Fed has changed rates eight times and maintained them five times.
This history suggests that the central bank does not shy away from making policy changes during election periods if warranted by economic indicators.
While the market reacts to the latest inflation data and its implications, the Federal Reserve, under Chair Powell's leadership, remains committed to responding to economic data.
Hence, Gavekal Research strategists conclude that an interest rate change before the November elections is likely if the current inflationary trends persist.

SPXL,2024-06-27,"Fed's Bostic expects one rate cut in 2024, as many as four in 2025",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-bostic-expects-one-rate-102344205.html,"Raphael Bostic, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, stated that a potential cut in the federal funds rate could occur in the fourth quarter of this year, emphasizing a data-driven approach to future policy decisions.
For 2025, Bostic penciled in 5 rate cuts. This outlook is not set in stone, as the policymaker acknowledged the unpredictability of the current economic climate, suggesting that rate cuts, holds, or increases could all be warranted depending on evolving conditions.
""There are plausible scenarios in which more cuts, no cuts, or even a raise could be appropriate. I will let the data and conditions on the ground be my guide,"" Bostic said in a prepared speech.
He also underscored the commitment to reducing inflation to the 2 percent target, which is seen as essential for widespread prosperity and effective decision-making among families and businesses.
Achieving this goal does not imply a reduction in prices to pre-2021 levels but aims to create an economic environment where inflation does not heavily influence the mindset of consumers and producers.
Bostic also pointed out the need to look beyond headline figures, noting that despite a semblance of normalcy returning in many aspects of life, the economy is still significantly impacted by the global pandemic.
The effects of policy measures in response to the pandemic have supported the labor market and the broader economy, even amid aggressive monetary policy tightening.
One of the first economic sectors to feel the impact of monetary policy changes is housing, due to its sensitivity to interest rates.
Mortgage banking executives have reported a de facto recession in their industry for the past year as mortgage rates have surged to levels above 7%, a significant increase from previous rates.

SPXL,2024-06-21,Fed’s Barkin wants more evidence on inflation before rate cuts,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-barkin-wants-more-evidence-034323720.html,"Thomas Barkin, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond stressed the need for further clarity on the inflation path before considering lowering interest rates.
""My personal view is let’s get more conviction before moving,” Bakin told reporters following an event in Richmond on Thursday.
He emphasized the importance of sustained and broad progress toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target before making any adjustments to borrowing costs.
Barkin, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, believes that the current monetary policy is well-positioned and that the central bank has sufficient firepower to fight inflation.
When questioned about the possibility of a single rate cut followed by a pause, Barkin said the decision would depend on the economic conditions at the time. He also said that it might not be appropriate to provide guidance on the timing of future policy changes if current conditions remain.
""There are times where we will want to give forward guidance and have given forward guidance,” Barkin said. “This doesn’t feel like one of those times to me. It doesn’t feel like a forward guidance time.”
“At this moment it feels like if you made a cut, you made a cut, and then let’s see where the data takes you,” Barkin continued.
Last week, policymakers decided to keep interest rates steady within the 5.25% to 5.5% range, the highest in over two decades. Per the median projection, policymakers expect one rate cut in 2024 and four in 2025.
Earlier this week, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler pointed out several reasons for optimism that inflation is on course to meet the U.S. central bank's 2% goal.
Specifically, Kugler said she believes that the current monetary policy is ""sufficiently restrictive"" to reduce price pressures without significantly harming the job market.
""If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year,"" Kugler remarked at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She found the recent data encouraging, particularly a government report showing that consumer prices remained flat from April to May.
Though more progress is needed, Kugler maintained a positive outlook, saying the current economic conditions “are moving in the right direction.""

SPXL,2024-06-12,Attention to this expert: What if there is no rate cut in the U.S. in 2024?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/attention-expert-no-rate-cut-080928330.html,"Investing.com - Markets are tense Wednesday due to two key events: the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May and the interest rate decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).

Experts are starting to consider the possibility that the Fed might significantly lower its expectations for rate cuts. Some even suggest that we might not see any rate cuts at all.
""To say there are mixed macro data in the U.S. economy is an understatement compared to what's being published: a good example is the ISM, which shows an intense slowdown in its manufacturing part (dropping from 49.2 to 48.7, below the expected 49.5), while its services version accelerated from 49.4 to 53.8, far exceeding the estimated 51. In other words, we are facing a clear dichotomy between the industrial and services sectors, implying slower future growth... but an economic powerhouse at present,"" explains Pedro del Pozo, financial investment director at Mutualidad.
""As if this weren't enough, the employment data was simply perplexing: on one hand, net job creation was spectacular, with 272,000 new jobs compared to the expected 180,000. In sum, a locomotive running at full steam... or perhaps not: Unemployment rose to 4.0%, while the participation rate fell, which is incongruous. In other words, we are seeing very strong tensions in the U.S. labor market, sending signals of genuine uncertainty,"" adds Del Pozo.
According to this expert, ""also in the U.S., markets have taken these data in the worst possible way, with sharp drops in debt and more moderate declines in stocks, which see the possibility of rate cuts in 2024 fading. If cuts do occur - unless the unemployment and ISM manufacturing data decisively outdo their employment and services counterparts in the very short term - it would almost certainly be after the presidential elections on November 5.""
""How far away do the possible March rate cuts seem, don't they?"" asks Pedro del Pozo.
Europe
In Europe, most of the attention during the last ECB meeting was focused on the institution's new macro projections. ""In truth, what we've seen is an exercise in adapting to new macroeconomic conditions, as a result of which the official core inflation forecasts have risen from 2.6% to 2.8% this year, and from 2.1% to 2.2% in 2025. In other words, the ECB estimates that it will not reach its CPI target until the end of next year or early 2026. Naturally, this means a new roadmap regarding the pace of interest rate cuts, as we mentioned at the beginning of the article,"" explains Del Pozo.

SPXL,2024-05-31,"Fed not likely to begin cutting rates in July, says Atlanta President Bostic",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-not-likely-begin-cutting-043030343.html,"Raphael Bostic, the Atlanta Federal Reserve President, said Thursday that U.S. central bankers are unlikely to cut interest rates in July, citing slowed progress on inflation.
“I'm keeping my eyes on the short-run trajectory, and if we can continue to see that trajectory move forward, I think we will be in a good place,” Bostic told Fox Business when asked if the Fed might ease rates in July.
“I don't think that's going to be in July,” he added.
The Atlanta Fed President stressed the need for economic data showing the economy is ""sufficiently strong"" and inflation has moved closer to the Fed's 2% target before supporting any rate reductions.
""That's not my outlook today,” Bostic noted.
However, Bostic, a voting member of the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee this year, claimed he would not wait for inflation to hit 2% before loosening monetary policy.
“That would really cause inflation to overshoot, and that wouldn't be ideal,"" he said. The Fed official expects inflation to decrease ""very slowly"" throughout the year, potentially reaching 2% by 2025 or later.
In their May meeting, officials voted to hold interest rates steady at 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level since 2001. While they left the possibility of rate cuts later this year open, policymakers emphasized the need for ""greater confidence"" that inflation is decreasing before easing policy.
Recent data shows some signs of easing inflation. The April consumer price index indicated a slight cooling to 3.4%, down from 3.5% the previous month, easing investor fears of rising prices.
However, minutes from the May meeting revealed that officials are prepared to keep rates elevated longer after disappointing inflation readings in early 2024 and are willing to hike rates again if necessary.
Bostic said that he does not foresee raising rates again this year unless there is evidence of increasing price pressures in the economy.
""I've been on the record for more than a year now saying, 'I don't think that's going to be required for us to get to our 2% target,'"" he said in the interview with Fox Business.
""I still believe that today. But if it were the case that inflation moved in the other direction, and we started to see some reacceleration in pricing power, I'd have to take on board the likelihood that a rate increase is appropriate. But I don't see that happening today.""

SPXL,2024-05-30,Fed's Logan sees inflation trending toward 2% target,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-logan-sees-inflation-trending-175010260.html,"Lorie Logan, the President of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, said today that she sees inflation making progress towards the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
Speaking at an event in El Paso, Texas, Logan conveyed a cautious optimism about reaching the inflation goal, albeit with an acknowledgment of potential deviations from the expected path.
""I think there's good reasons to think that we're headed to 2% -- we're still on that path, perhaps a bit slower and a little bit bumpier than maybe many thought at the beginning of the year,"" Logan said.
She pointed out that there are still significant risks that inflation could trend higher than desired.
This acknowledgment of ""upside risks"" around inflation suggests vigilance on the part of the Federal Reserve as it monitors economic indicators and adjusts its policies accordingly.
The Federal Reserve has consistently aimed for a 2% inflation rate as a benchmark for economic stability.

SPXL,2024-05-30,"Fed's Williams sees monetary policy as restrictive, no rush to adjust",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-williams-sees-monetary-policy-123947794.html,"New York Federal Reserve President John Williams stated on Thursday that there is ""ample evidence"" that the current monetary policy is having a restrictive impact, signaling a cautious stance on any immediate changes to interest rates.
The official noted that while the Fed does not know exactly when it will cut rates, any such decision will be data-dependent.
The central bank representative emphasized that there is no urgency to adjust the monetary policy at present.
This suggests that the Federal Reserve is inclined to maintain the current interest rate levels until substantial economic indicators prompt a policy change.
Moreover, the official pointed out that achieving a 2% inflation rate is not a prerequisite for the Fed to consider lowering rates.
The Fed's official also expressed an expectation that shelter inflation, which has been a significant component of overall inflation, will continue to decrease.
This trend is seen as a positive sign for the economy, potentially easing inflationary pressures in the housing sector.
Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve forecasts that inflation will reach the target 2% rate in early 2026.

SPXL,2024-05-20,Fed's Daly sees no immediate need to raise rates amid inflation concerns,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-sees-no-immediate-125759160.html,"Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly today expressed skepticism about inflation declining sustainably to the 2% target.
The senior Fed official noted a lack of confidence in a consistent downward trend and did not observe any current evidence necessitating an increase in interest rates.
Moreover, Daly anticipated improvements in shelter inflation but cautioned that such improvements would not be rapid.
The remarks reflect ongoing deliberations within the Federal Reserve regarding the appropriate monetary policy response to inflationary pressures.
While the central bank aims for a 2% inflation rate as a sign of a healthy economy, the recent statement indicates that this goal has not yet been convincingly met.

SPXL,2024-05-16,Warning: This recession signal if flashing red,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warning-recession-signal-flashing-red-115904522.html,"BCA Research highlighted a potential signal for an impending US recession based on historical patterns of unemployment rates.
According to their analysis, the 3-month moving average of the unemployment rate has risen to 3.87% from a low of 3.5% earlier in 2023, marking a concerning trend.
The recent uptick in April from 3.8% to 3.9% has triggered what BCA refers to as a recession signal, also ticking a box in their Equity Downgrade Checklist.
BCA's report also notes that small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which form the bulk of US employment, have shown decreasing hiring intentions for the coming three months. This trend is expected to exert additional upward pressure on the unemployment rate.
BCA's findings suggest that the labor market softening could lead to slower income growth amidst dwindling excess savings and tighter consumer credit, potentially hampering consumer spending.
Adding to the recession indicators, BCA points to several segments of the yield curve that are currently inverted, alongside a contraction in the US Leading Economic Index on a year-on-year basis.
Another metric, known internally at BCA as the ""Mel Rule,"" which is based on state-level unemployment rates, is also indicating potential economic trouble ahead.
""We do not subscribe to the no-landing narrative and expect that a continuation of the softening trend in labor demand will lead to decelerating income growth at the same time that excess savings dry up and consumer credit becomes more scarce, hobbling consumption growth,"" BCA said.
""Investors should underweight risk-assets on a cyclical investment horizon. Given sanguine market sentiment equities are at a heightened risk of declining.""

TQQQ,2024-07-15,"Investors Bought Up IWM, RSP Last Week",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-bought-iwm-rsp-last-211949252.html,"A cool $36 billion flowed into U.S.-listed ETFs during the week ending Friday, July 12, pushing year-to-date inflows above $406 billion.

U.S. equity ETFs pulled in the bulk of the weekly inflows as stocks continued to hit record highs, but fixed income ETFs also saw demand as rate cut expectations ticked higher following the latest inflation data.

The S&P 500 was up by almost 19% on a year-to-date basis on Friday. Investors cheered data which showed a smaller-than-expected increase in consumer prices last month.

The probability of a rate cut in September neared 90% after the CPI data came out, which also lent support to bond prices.

Individual flows winners for last week include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).

Small caps handily outperformed their large cap counterparts last week as investors rotated into cheaper stocks from the megacap stocks that have led this year’s rally.

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) was also in high demand with weekly inflows of $1 billion. The daily return differential between RSP and SPY on Thursday—the day the CPI data came out—was the largest since 2020.

Still, despite there being some rotation from megacaps to smaller stocks, the tech giants that dominate the S&P 500 remain close to their all-time highs. 

In other words, everything seems to be working all of a sudden—mega caps, small caps and everything in between.

Only one ETF saw outflows of more than $1 billion last week: the Invesco Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor ETF (OMFL). 

The Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 2X Shares (SOXL) and the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) followed suit with outflows of $663 million and $446 million, respectively, on what seems to be profit taking after huge rallies.

The two ETFs are up 106% and 62%, respectively, so far this year.
