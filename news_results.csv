AAPB,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

AAPB,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

AAPB,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

AAPB,2024-10-02,How investors can get in on the China stock rally with ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-china-stock-rally-etfs-172514354.html,"China stocks (^HSI) have extended their rally after the People's Bank of China unveiled new stimulus measures in an effort to recover its struggling economy.
Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

AAPB,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

AAPB,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

AAPB,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

AAPB,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

AAPB,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

AAPB,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In a lower interest rate environment, Powers focuses on traditional defensive sectors like utilities (XLU), consumer staples XLP (XLP), and financials XLF (XLF), noting that “we still expect some short-term volatility as we enter October, which is historically the most volatile month of the year in election years.”

Meanwhile, Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist, breaks down the pros and cons between buying now and waiting. ""Now we're at that seasonal slowdown sweet spot for buyers. So there's less competition which can make it easier to snag a deal on a home. At the same time, you might see lower rates if you wait into the spring. But you might have to offset those lower rates with more competition and better prices. You know, in essence, I don't think buyers can go wrong either way,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

AAPB,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

AAPB,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

AAPB,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

AAPB,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

AMDL,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

AMDL,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

AMDL,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

AMDL,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

AMDL,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

AMDL,2024-09-30,"Labor market in focus, port strike looms ahead: Morning Brief",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/labor-market-focus-port-strike-165636574.html,"On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills analyze the market open and discuss some of the biggest stories of the trading day.
All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

AMDL,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

AMDL,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

AMDL,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

AMDL,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window.

AMDL,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

AMDL,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

AMDL,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

AMDL,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

CLOU,2024-05-10,ETF Spotlight: EBIZ Regains Momentum After Brief Dip,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etf-spotlight-ebiz-regains-momentum-173000824.html,"Global X E-commerce ETF (EBIZ) shares climbed more than a percentage point on Thursday, returning to its months-long perch in positive territory.
The e-commerce-focused fund has soared about 40% over the past year to trade above $24, a result of robust consumer spending that has been driving U.S. post-Covid economic growth and sent stocks in the sector higher. It has risen more than 20% this year.
EBIZ had dipped the previous day along with other major e-commerce companies— First Trust Dow Jones International Internet ETF (FDNI), the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU), and ProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN)—after e-commerce software developer Shopify Inc. reported disappointing guidance for its second quarter and the company's share price plunged more than 20%.
FDNI, CLOU and ONLN were back in the green on Thursday. They have benefited from steady gains from online retail and related stocks that are their primary holdings and that have been swept upward by surprisingly robust U.S. consumer spending, particularly online. ONLN is up more than 35% during the past year.

U.S. e-commerce sales in 2023 rose by 7.6%, outpacing the 2.1% gain for retail sales broadly, according to the Census Bureau. Globally, e-commerce sales grew a faster 10% and are expected to grow another 9% this year.
EBIZ's Global Portfolio
EBIZ, which started trading in November 2018 and has about $76 million in assets under management, has targeted the growing importance of e-commerce by tracking online retailers, marketplace platforms, and supporting businesses—such as software providers—that generate at least 50% of their revenues from e-commerce-related operations.
About two-thirds of its portfolio are U.S.-based companies, but the fund has a global footprint. Its second largest holding—more than 4%—is the Singapore-based conglomerate Sea Limited. Tempe, Ariz.-based Carvana Co., the largest holding, also makes up more than 4% of EBIZ's holdings, as do retail giants Amazon.com Inc. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. and Ottawa-based Shopify.
According to Shopify’s Global Ecommerce Sales Growth Report, online sales are expected to “continue rising and take a larger piece of the retail pie.” 
 
“In 2025, global ecommerce sales are forecast to rise to $6.86 trillion, before adding another $550 billion in 2026, to $7.41 trillion. By 2027, it’s estimated that world retail ecommerce sales will hit $7.96 trillion,” according to the report.

CLOU,2024-05-08,Online Retail ETFs Plunge After Shopify Earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/online-retail-etfs-plunge-shopify-230154640.html,"E-commerce exchange-traded funds tumbled on Wednesday as shares of Shopify plunged by nearly 20%.
The developer of software for running online stores said that its expenses will rise in the second quarter, while its revenue growth will decelerate.
Ottawa-based Shopify has a market capitalization of $80 billion, making it one of the world’s largest e-commerce companies.
The stock has substantial weightings in funds like the First Trust Dow Jones International Internet ETF (FDNI), the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU), and the Global X E-Commerce ETF (EBIZ).
Shopify reported healthy earnings for the first quarter. Merchants using the company’s platform sold $60.9 billion worth of goods and services, generating $1.9 billion of revenues for Shopify. Both figures were up 23% from a year ago.
However, Shopify said that its second quarter revenue growth rate would slow to “a high-teens percentage rate,” disappointing investors.
The firm also forecast that operating expenses in second quarter would rise by a “low-to-mid-single digit percentage rate compared to Q1 2024.” 
 
Analysts at Baird said that Shopify’s higher operating expense guidance overshadows “an otherwise solid report.” 
 
They said that the company is “probably leaning into marketing and R&D (AI/GenAI) investments,” but “without a clear positive impact on [gross merchandise value] and revenues from recent investments, investors will question the margin trajectory.”
E-Commerce Soars
Shopify’s drop on Wednesday was a black eye for the e-commerce industry, but it did little to dent the strong performance for e-commerce stocks as a whole this year.
EBIZ is still up 13.1% year-to-date, while the ProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN) is up by 12.3%.
U.S. e-commerce sales in 2023 rose by 7.6%, outpacing the 2.1% gain for retail sales broadly, according to the Census Bureau.
Globally, e-commerce sales grew a faster 10% and are expected to grow another 9% this year.
According to Shopify’s Global Ecommerce Sales Growth Report, online sales are expected to “continue rising and take a larger piece of the retail pie.”

CLOU,2024-02-13,Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU) Hits New 52-Week High,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloud-computing-etf-clou-hits-193400204.html,"For investors seeking momentum, GX Cloud Computing ETF CLOU is probably on the radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up 47.94% from its 52-week low price of $16/share.
But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed:
CLOU in Focus
The underlying Indxx Global Cloud Computing Index provides exposure to exchange-listed companies in developed and emerging markets that are positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of cloud computing technology. The product charges 68 bps in annual fees (See: All Technology ETFs).
Why the Move?
The cloud computing corner of the broad stock market has been an area to watch lately, given rising demand. Cloud computing has been an important catalyst in technological advancement, offering efficient solutions to consumers and enterprises alike. Advancements in cloud tech like AI and cybersecurity have broadened cloud service applications, drawing in a wider customer demographic. Additionally, growing investments in cloud infrastructure have played a pivotal role in driving growth.
More Gains Ahead?
Currently, CLOU has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and might continue its strong performance in the near term, with a positive weighted alpha of 34.21, which gives cues of a further rally.

DFEN,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

DFEN,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

DFEN,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

DFEN,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

DFEN,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

DFEN,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

DFEN,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

DFEN,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

DFEN,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs.

If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

DFEN,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

DFEN,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

DFEN,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

DFEN,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

DPST,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

DPST,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

DPST,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.

DPST,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

DPST,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

DPST,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

DPST,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

DPST,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk

DPST,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

Matt Powers, Powers Advisory Group managing partner, discusses how to best position your portfolio in a rate-easing cycle and an election year. In a lower interest rate environment, Powers focuses on traditional defensive sectors like utilities (XLU), consumer staples XLP (XLP), and financials XLF (XLF), noting that “we still expect some short-term volatility as we enter October, which is historically the most volatile month of the year in election years.”
As mortgage rates hit a two-year low, Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero breaks down what it means for potential homebuyers as they navigate the housing market. Meanwhile, Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist, breaks down the pros and cons between buying now and waiting. ""Now we're at that seasonal slowdown sweet spot for buyers. So there's less competition which can make it easier to snag a deal on a home. At the same time, you might see lower rates if you wait into the spring. But you might have to offset those lower rates with more competition and better prices. You know, in essence, I don't think buyers can go wrong either way,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

In August, LegalShield's Consumer Stress Legal Index ticked up to its highest level since November 2020. In presidential battleground states, stress rose even more, and historically, that elevated battleground stress during October and November has resulted in a Republican White House win. LegalShield SVP of Consumer Analytics Matt Layton explains, ""Our index is really made up of three different subindices: The bankruptcy index, foreclosure index, and a consumer finance index. Each of those three individuals are also increasing over the last several months. But when we speak to our lawyers, we hear issues like job security, layoffs — folks are concerned about their jobs. They don't have enough money at the end of the month to pay their bills.""
If you received a tax extension in April, the due date is October 15 — just over two weeks away. Tom O’Saben, National Association of Tax Professionals director of tax content, notes that it is crucial to pay your taxes on time to avoid any penalties, which could be as much as 5% per month. In addition, failure to pay the penalty could end up being as much as 25% of the tax itself. He warns that the statute of limitations for the IRS to audit a return is unlimited for returns that aren't filed, compared to the normal three-year window. If you don't have the ability to pay your taxes in full, O’Saben explains that the IRS offers both short-term and long-term payment plans.

DPST,2024-09-27,Best ETF to Buy: VanEck Semiconductor ETF vs. iShares Semiconductor ETF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-etf-buy-vaneck-semiconductor-120500928.html,"Semiconductor stocks have been soaring, led by Nvidia. But that's been far from the only winner -- other popular names like Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have all surged since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.
If you want exposure to a group of stocks, a smart way to do so is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds trade like stocks but hold a range of companies instead of just one. An ETF is the easiest way to quickly diversify your holdings across a sector like semiconductors.
The two largest semiconductor ETFs are the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). Let's compare the two to see which one is the better option.
Image source: Getty Images.
A choice of two types of semiconductor ETFs
You might think the composition of these two ETFs would be the same, but that's not the case. Unlike rival index funds, which have similar compositions due to tracking the same underlying index, these two ETFs are based on different indexes.
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, while the iShares version follows the NYSE Semiconductor Index.
As a result, there are significant differences between their five biggest holdings, as you can see from this chart.
VanEck ETF
iShares ETF
Nvidia:19.5%
Broadcom: 8.7%
Taiwan Semiconductor: 12.5%
Advanced Micro Devices: 8.7%
Broadcom: 8.1%
Nvidia: 8%
Texas Instruments: 5.1%
Qualcomm: 6.2%
Advanced Micro Devices: 4.9%
Texas Instruments: 6.1%
Source: company websites. Data as of 9/20/24.
The VanEck ETF has more than double the exposure to Nvidia that the iShares ETF does. Importantly, the iShares ETF doesn't own foreign stocks, such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and the Netherlands-based ASML, two of the top semiconductor stocks. Arguably, that gives the VanEck ETF an advantage. While TSMC is the second-largest holding in the VanEck fund, ASML is the sixth-largest.
The VanEck ETF holds 26 stocks, while the iShares ETF owns 30.
The performance comparison
Based on the chart above, it probably won't surprise you that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF recently since it has greater exposure to Nvidia.
In the 10 years before the start of the generative AI boom at the beginning of 2023, the iShares ETF outperformed the VanEck, as you can see from the chart below.
SMH Chart
But since then, the VanEck ETF has dominated, dating back to 2013.
SMH Chart
Since the beginning of 2023, the difference between the two funds is even clearer.
SMH Chart
Based on recent performance, it seems like the VanEck ETF has the edge here.

DPST,2024-09-27,"1 Unstoppable Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-semiconductor-etf-could-092900211.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution wouldn't be possible without semiconductors. They fill the data centers that developers use to build AI models, and they power the computers and devices we use to access the technology.
Picking the winners and losers in the semiconductor space won't be easy because the pace of innovation is staggering. Nvidia had a market capitalization of $360 billion at the start of 2023, and less than two years later, it now stands at a whopping $3 trillion! The company dominates the AI chip space right now, but that doesn't mean it will forever.
Therefore, rather than buying individual stocks, investors might want to look at the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) instead. It holds every major AI chip stock you could want to own, and consistently crushes the return of the S&P 500 index.
In fact, here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return from here if this scenario plays out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Every leading AI chip stock in one place
The iShares Semiconductor ETF aims to give investors exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips, but it's especially focused on those that will benefit from the rise of AI.
The ETF only holds 30 different stocks, and its top five positions account for 37.5% of the total value of its entire portfolio. In other words, it's highly concentrated:
Stock
iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting
1. Broadcom
8.72%
2. Advanced Micro Devices
8.67%
3. Nvidia
8.00%
4. Texas Instruments
6.10%
5. Qualcomm
6.07%
Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 23, 2024, and are subject to change.
Broadcom has a booming semiconductor business, which produces specialized data center chips called AI accelerators. Plus, it makes data center networking equipment like switches that regulate how fast data travels from one point to another. In the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its AI accelerator segment grew by three-and-a-half times year over year, and sales of its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches saw fourfold growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is trying to catch up to Nvidia in the market for data center graphics processors (GPUs), and it's having some success thanks to its new MI300 chips. However, the company's Ryzen AI chips have taken a leadership position in the personal computing market, where Nvidia doesn't operate. They facilitate on-device AI processing, circumventing data centers to create a faster user experience. Ryzen AI hardware can be found in millions of computers already, from manufacturers like HP, Asus, and Lenovo.

DPST,2024-09-25,Rate cuts will fuel an 'upswing' for these sectors: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rate-cuts-fuel-upswing-sectors-214318154.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have pulled back from their all-time highs, with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the latest movement and what investors can expect in the second half of the year.
Pettit believes the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut is behind the most recent market action. He explains, ""I think the Fed, and honestly heading into the Fed decision, interest rates across the curve coming down gave people more confidence to look through some potential softness in the labor market, maybe a little bit of softness in earnings macro data, even the housing data today, out the other side to say, 'Hey, the Fed isn't going to be as far behind the curve. That's OK. I can start positioning for the recovery.' And we've seen not just the secular stories work, but we've seen some of the cyclical stories start to work, at least since the mid-July interim peak.""

As the third quarter earnings season looms ahead, he believes the market has not reached its peak. He notes that growth stocks can ""probably survive any type of weakness,"" while cyclicals will finally get a boost from falling interest rates. Pettit adds, ""We actually think we're on an upswing for some of the parts of the market that really haven't gotten much love over the past couple of years.""
While tech stocks have gotten a lot of love over the last year, he expects some pressure ahead: ""The growth side of the market has had really strong growth. So it becomes the problem of, let's call it, the law of large numbers. You're growing really fast. It's hard to keep that up forever. But when growth stocks see their sales decelerate, there's been points in the past where that has actually pressured their earnings."" However, he believes many Tech players will be able to handle topline deceleration.
Thus, Pettit encourages investors to be cautious with tech moving forward. He encourages them instead to get into overlooked areas of the market like cyclicals, consumer goods (XLP, XLY), and financials (XLF).

DPST,2024-09-25,Why there's 'upside' in the S&P 500 as the Fed lowers rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-theres-upside-p-500-161923164.html,"The Federal Reserve kicked off its highly anticipated interest rate easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point cut. Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment.
""So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance.
With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. ""When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,"" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates.

As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: ""What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.""
Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company ""one of the most valuable brands in the world,"" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a ""turnaround story"" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.

NEW YORK, July 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck is today celebrating the fact that its VanEck Merk Gold Trust (OUNZ) recently surpassed $1B in assets under management (AUM).
OUNZ, which launched in May of 2014, has for the last decade provided investors with the means to not only add gold exposure to their portfolios but also to take physical delivery of their gold holdings. Underpinning OUNZ is a proprietary process developed by its sponsor, Merk Investments LLC, through which investors are able to request and then take possession of gold coins and bars in the denominations they desire. Investors taking delivery of their physical gold via OUNZ do not encounter a taxable event, as they are merely taking possession of what they already own: the gold.
""While the price of gold has been increasing in 2024, few gold-focused exchange-traded products have seen inflows. OUNZ has actually been seeing relatively consistent inflows for the last several years, a testament to the unique features of the offering,"" said Ed Lopez, Head of Product Management with VanEck. ""VanEck traces its history in gold investing back more than 50 years, and we’ve long prided ourselves on delivering innovative ways for investors to add the yellow metal to their portfolios. This is a significant milestone that we’re pleased to celebrate.""
VanEck has been at the forefront of gold investing since the firm’s inception. The firm offers both actively and passively managed investment solutions, including the US’s first gold stock fund, VanEck International Investors Gold Fund (INIVX), launched in 1968; the first gold miners ETF, VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX); and the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ).
""We join our partners at VanEck in celebrating this milestone for OUNZ,"" added Axel Merk, President and Chief Investment Officer with Merk Investments. ""Gold’s role in times of uncertainty, like those through which we have been living and investing the past several years, is well known. But we’re pleased to note that OUNZ’s unique approach and the means through which we can provide investors with access to physical gold is becoming just as well known and accepted.""

About VanEck
VanEck has a history of looking beyond the financial markets to identify trends that are likely to create impactful investment opportunities. We were one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international markets. This set the tone for the firm’s drive to identify asset classes and trends – including gold investing in 1968, emerging markets in 1993, and exchange traded funds in 2006 – that subsequently shaped the investment management industry.

NEW YORK, April 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck is today celebrating that CEO Jan van Eck was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 ETF.com Awards.
In 2006, van Eck boldly led the firm’s entry into the ETF space with the launch of the now $14 billion VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), and the firm recently surpassed $100 billion in AUM. He has fostered a commitment to product innovation centered around the firm’s core investment philosophy that financial markets are a reflection of a broader world that encompasses economic, political, technological and social dynamics. This is evident in the firm’s ETFs, which include the VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT) and ""moat""-focused fund suite, the VanEck Fallen Angel High Yield Bond ETF (ANGL), and more.
""I am honored by this recognition. It is a reflection of the strong team here at VanEck as well as our partnerships across the industry, from index firms and liquidity providers to stock exchanges,"" said van Eck. ""One of the biggest lessons from my career is simply: don’t give up. I had tried different things over my career and was in my 40s when the firm started in ETFs, so from my own experience, I know that success sometimes takes time.""
This tenacity, dedication to product development and van Eck’s long-standing belief in the transformative potential of bitcoin is evident in the firm’s digital assets efforts, where it was the first established ETF issuer to file for a bitcoin-linked ETF in 2017.
The ETF.com Awards serve to recognize and honor exceptional achievements within the ETF space, particularly those remarkable individuals, companies and products that have left an indelible mark on the ETF ecosystem. Held each year in New York City, the award ceremony is attended by hundreds of professionals in the space and is closely followed by investors, advisors and financial industry professionals around the world.

GDX,2024-04-09,Gold's Rise Taunts Advisors Who've Seen This Before,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/golds-rise-taunts-advisors-whove-120000795.html,"Better late than never.
That might describe the recent breakout for the price of gold in U.S dollar terms. After several flirtatious attempts going back more than a decade, it finally crossed $2,000 an ounce and stayed there for longer than a fortnight.
Gold pierced that round number mark back in August of 2020, only to disappoint those expecting it to skyrocket higher. And way back in September of 2011, gold peaked at more than $1,900 an ounce. At the time, it seemed destined to go up much more, or so the headlines at the time claimed.
Gold, with limited industrial applications but centuries of symbolism and use as an actual currency, has its army of perma-bulls. Still, for a long time, advances in the metal's prices have been slapped back like a rejected basketball shot.
Now, with a closing price last Friday above $2,300 an ounce, and up more than 25% since last October, gold fans are feeling it again. And who can blame them. Inflation may be re-accelerating, the U.S. Dollar is backing a $34 trillion pile of debt, and market technicians can make a case for much higher prices, now that the long-term “breakout” has finally occurred.
Gold ETFs Ups and Downs
Parabolic moves like the one gold just had might be a double-edged sword. Holders of the two dominant asset-gatherers in the gold commodity space, the $61 billion SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and the $28 billion iShares Gold Trust (IAU) have seen those ETFs move like a roller coaster in recent years. They've doubled since early 2016.
Financial advisors have watched clients get excited about big moves in tech stocks and small caps, a giant bond market rebound, and bitcoin. And that’s just in recent memory. Yet all of those moves have, or are hinting at, what I refer to as the “Empire State Building” chart formation. That is, a sudden spike higher, that soon reverses in large part or in total. Picture the top of New York’s Empire State Building, which narrows at the top, then ends with a long needle at the peak. But that needle has two sides. Will the gold chart resemble that in a few months?
Gold is a most intriguing ETF asset class, since it can be owned via funds that track the price of gold, the commodity. However, gold mining stock ETFs allow advisors to allocate to a version of the gold trade that has revenue, earnings, people, and operations behind it. That all just happens to involve the business of mining that yellow metal.
Gold Mining Stock ETFs
Funds like the $14.2 billion Van Eck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) and the $114 million Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM) are among the 14 gold mining ETFs tracked by the etf.com database. And unlike gold itself, they are still quite a distance from making all-time highs. They are part of the basic material sector, which is a small portion of the S&P 500 that hasn't kept up with market leaders in tech and elsewhere. That could set up an opportunity for advisors to increase allocations to a relatively out of favor industry that can potentially follow its underlying commodity price higher.

(TSX: CXB; OTCQX: CXBMF) (the ""Company"" or ""Calibre"") is pleased to announce the operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (all financial amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated). 
Darren Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Calibre, stated: “Consistent with H1 2024 production expectations the team delivered 61,767 ounces in Q1, with gold production H2 weighted as additional organic production sources and higher-grade zones of gold mineralization are brought into the mine plan. We remain on track to deliver full year 2024 production guidance of 275,000 – 300,000 ounces.
The beginning of 2024 has proven to be exciting for Calibre with the close of the acquisition of the multi-million-ounce Valentine Gold Mine (“VGM”) in Canada, a fourth consecutive year of Mineral Reserve growth and our inclusion into the Van Eck GDX Index. Since becoming a gold producer during Q4, 2019, Calibre has delivered annual production growth of 28% year on year, with a track record of meeting or beating expectations. We are on a clear and concise path of delivery and growth. With an investment of more than 130,000 metres of resource expansion and discovery drilling in 2024, I am excited to see continued positive results across our entire portfolio of assets.
2024 and 2025 will be transformational years, driven by an increase in gold production and significant exploration across the Americas. I am pleased to report the final phases of construction and operational readiness remain on track and fully funded at VGM in preparation for first gold production in H1, 2025 to unlock significant production growth and value for our shareholders.
During this time of significant growth, Calibre remains committed to its pursuit of excellence in sustainability and ethical mining practices. Our efforts extend beyond regulatory compliance, focusing on continuous improvement to minimize our environmental footprint, as well as transparent and extensive community engagement to create a positive impact in the regions in which we operate.”
Q1 2024 Highlights
Completed the acquisition of Marathon Gold, securing significant future growth as construction of the multi-million-ounce Valentine Gold Mine surpasses 61% complete;

Notes:
(1) NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company believes that investors use certain non-IFRS measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies, specifically Total Cash Costs per Ounce and All-In Sustaining Costs per Ounce. In the gold mining industry, these are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Total Cash Costs per Ounce of Gold: Total cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, and local administrative costs (including stock-based compensation related to mine operations), royalties, production taxes, mine standby costs and current inventory write downs, if any. Production costs are exclusive of depreciation and depletion, reclamation, capital, and exploration costs. Total cash costs per gold ounce are net of by-product silver sales and are divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.
All-In Sustaining Costs per Ounce of Gold: A performance measure that reflects all of the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from current operations. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company’s definition is derived from the AISC definition as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance dated June 27, 2013 and November 16, 2018. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory, non-profit organization established in 1987 whose members include global senior mining companies. The Company believes that this measure will be useful to external users in assessing operating performance and the ability to generate free cash flow from current operations. The Company defines AISC as the sum of total cash costs (per above), sustaining capital (capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels), capital lease repayments, corporate general and administrative expenses, exploration expenditures designed to increase resource confidence at producing mines, amortization of asset retirement costs and rehabilitation accretion related to current operations. AISC excludes capital expenditures for significant improvements at existing operations deemed to be expansionary in nature, exploration and evaluation related to resource growth, rehabilitation accretion and amortization not related to current operations, financing costs, debt repayments, and taxes. Total all-in sustaining costs are divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.

GDX,2024-04-01,Gold Mining Stocks Are Stupid Cheap as Gold Prices Hit Record Highs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-mining-stocks-stupid-cheap-183813124.html,"Are you considering investing in gold mining stocks as the price of gold rallies? There are several reasons why now might be a good time. First and foremost, they can provide a quasi-form of leveraged exposure to gold prices. If the price of gold rises, gold mining stocks may rise even more.
But that’s not the only reason. Many gold mining stocks offer dividends, providing a source of income in addition to potential capital appreciation. Investing in gold mining stocks can provide diversification benefits, as they often have a low correlation with other assets, such as stocks and bonds.
The valuations on gold mining stocks are stupid cheap.
Why Gold Mining Stocks Are Heating Up
I think a large part of the move in gold is due to its safe-haven status during times of geopolitical uncertainty, which can lead to increased demand for gold and gold mining stocks. If gold is indeed sending a warning, then mining stocks stand to benefit,  particularly since investors have largely ignored them in this AI-fueled market.
The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) offers quick, broad-based exposure to the gold mining industry without the need to pick individual stocks. This ETF focuses on established gold and silver mining companies with stable cash flows, making it suitable for the core of a gold allocation.
Just keep in mind that gold mining stocks are inherently volatile. As gold prices rise or fall, the profitability of mining companies is directly impacted, leading to corresponding movements in their stock prices.
Investors must also consider the operational risks associated with mining companies, such as higher production costs, which can erode profitability and lead to lower stock prices. Changes in government policies, regulations, and taxation in the countries where mining operations are located can also significantly impact the performance of gold mining stocks. None of this may matter in the here and now, but it is worth keeping in the back of your mind if you’re looking to make a longer-term allocation.
The Bottom Line
I like the space here. The only real complicating factor however is oil. Because mining operations are very energy intensive, surging oil prices can negate the impact of surging gold prices. The ideal scenario would be oil falling while gold continues to run. I think this is a distinct possibility.
Some would argue it’s better to just go direct and access gold itself rather than play with the stock side. I don’t disagree this is cleaner. But gold mining stocks are cheap, unloved, and have done nothing for some time. There’s an opportunity for momentum here, and I think it’s a good time to consider positioning as investors finally come around to my thesis that there is the potential for a reverse carry trade dynamic from Japan.

Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.
Video Transcript
- Let's get over to Jared Blikre for a closer look at some of the gains that we're seeing at the open, Jared.
JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Stocks are indeed ripping. We can see this across the board here. Small caps actually up the most, up nearly 1%. Dow is in the rear but it's still holding onto gains of about 54 basis points. I want to talk about gold right now then I'll get into some stock action. This is gold futures over the last month, and we are sitting on the sixth day of gains here. You can see we've really launched higher, pretty strong move.
And if you take a look at the prices that we've been at historically, and here's a better chart for you to gauge, you can see all this sideways action. And in fact, on a five-year chart you're going to see it goes back even farther. So when you have a long consolidation period, you tend to, and you get a breakout, you tend to go for extended periods after that as well. So it's all about momentum.
Now, here's the gold volatility index. Yes, there is a VIX of the gold. You can see rather low levels right now. But interestingly, gold tends to rise with volatility. So we actually want to see this move up and to support the move. And then finally, I want to check out with respect to gold, the miners, because they are lagging here. Gold is up here, miners down here. They got a game of catch up to do, which they usually do once the futures get going, so we'll have to see if that happens.
And then rounding out the precious precious metals, here's silver over five years. It is still stuck in its range. So it could very well break out, and it will eventually, but just not the time yet. Now, checking inside the market, interesting sector action. We have materials up the most. That's up 1% followed by tech, industrials, communication services, and utilities. So looking like a pretty healthy mix.
And for everybody worried about those mega-caps, even Apple, all of them up today. Broadcom, J was just talking about them, up 2%, looking forward to those earnings after the bell. Now bigger than Tesla, and there's Nvidia, another record high, up 2%. Guys.
- Keeps climbing to the upside. All right, Jared. Thanks so much for breaking that down for us.

GPIQ,2024-07-16,GPIQ: Goldman’s Monthly Dividend ETF with a Double-Digit Yield,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gpiq-goldman-monthly-dividend-etf-035242465.html,"Dividend ETFs that sell call options to generate high yields and monthly payouts have become popular, and blue-chip asset manager Goldman Sachs (GS) has its own entrant into the space with its new Goldman Sachs Nasdaq 100 Core Premium Income ETF (GPIQ).
I’m bullish on this new entrant into the space based on its sizable, double-digit distribution yield (explained in detail below), appealing monthly payout schedule, and diversified portfolio of highly-rated large-cap technology stocks.
What Is the GPIQ ETF’s Strategy?
According to Goldman Sachs, GPIQ “seeks current income while maintaining prospects for capital appreciation.”
Like other popular monthly dividend ETFs, Goldman Sachs explains that GPIQ “aims to generate a consistent monthly distribution rate generally from options premium and equity dividends.”
GPIQ invests in the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 and generates a steady stream of monthly income for its holders through dividends from its holdings and income received for selling covered calls against these holdings. Goldman states that GPIQ will typically sell calls in an amount ranging between 25% and 75% of the value of the fund’s equity portfolio. The fund also has the ability to invest in and sell calls on other ETFs and over-the-counter (OTC) instruments.
How Does GPIQ Generate Income?
Let’s take a closer look at how this strategy works in practice. GPIQ sells covered calls on the stocks it holds and uses the income it receives from selling these call contracts to distribute income to its holders on a monthly basis. This is an effective strategy for generating a sizable amount of income.
The inherent tradeoff that investors need to be aware of here is that GPIQ likely sacrifices a degree of potential upside from capital appreciation. When its holdings rise above the strike price for the calls it is selling, it doesn’t participate in any of the gains above this strike price because it is obligated to sell its shares at the contracted price.
As Goldman itself explains in the fund’s summary prospectus, “In rising markets where the aggregate
appreciation of the underlying index over its exercise price exceeds the income from premiums, a portfolio with a call writing strategy could underperform the same portfolio without the options.”
Let’s look at an example using GPIQ’s top holding, Apple (AAPL). GPIQ hypothetically sells Apple calls set to expire in a month with a strike price of $250. The fund theoretically receives a premium of $500 from the buyer of the options for selling these calls. However, if the shares of Apple settle at $275 on the closing date, GPIQ is contractually obligated to sell these shares to the buyer of the call for the contracted price of $250, meaning that it isn’t entitled to any of the gains above $250.

IWM,2024-10-03,Why Gen Z bets big while boomers play it safe: A generational breakdown of market returns,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gen-z-bets-big-while-boomers-play-it-safe-a-generational-breakdown-of-market-returns-163139081.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
It's a Goldilocks moment for investors.
As the books are closed on September, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has delivered a solid 20% return so far this year. Meanwhile, bonds are up a respectable 4.7%. And cash is yielding a similar percentage return — even after the Fed began cutting rates a few weeks ago.
But new research from Jack Manley at JPMorgan Asset Management uncovers hidden pitfalls, particularly for those entering their investment years during periods of high cash yields (much like the present). His findings suggest that all investors, regardless of generation, are heavily shaped by the market environment they grew up in.
Manley's methodology, rooted in demographic and behavioral analysis, assumes individuals begin investing 20 years after their generation's inception. For example, baby boomers started investing around 1966, Gen X in 1985, millennials in 2001, and Gen Z in 2017.
Source: FactSet, Robert Shiller, JPMorgan Asset Management. *Investment periods begin 20 years after each generation's inception based on the assumption that people have access to investable capital at this age. Investment periods begin in the following years: Baby Boomer (1966), Generation X (1985), Millennials (2001), Generation Z (2017). Annualized total returns are calculated using monthly data as of March 31, 2024. Data are as of June 30, 2024.
Over the decades, boomers have weathered all sorts of market turmoil, from the inflation crises of the 1970s to multiple tech booms later in life. With average annual stock returns around 10.2% and bond returns of 6.2%, their experience reflects a period of high growth and volatility.
As Manley explained in an episode of Stocks in Translation, “the Fed paid pathological attention” to the inflation crisis, and the entire experience had a profound effect in shaping boomers' cautious and diversified approach to investing — despite the strong returns.
For Generation X, the journey has been one of boom-bust cycles. But the older cohort of this group largely began investing amid a secular boom in markets. Entering adulthood during the 1980s, they witnessed the rise of tech but also faced brutal recessions, from the dot-com bubble to the 2008 financial crisis.
With returns hovering around 11.6% for stocks, their approach is cautious but optimistic. As Manley noted about the current market environment, “strong balance sheets are very important right now.” This may resonate with Gen X’s preference for financial resilience in uncertain times.
Millennials are the most educated generation, as measured by the percentage with bachelor's degrees or higher. But they have not fared as well in stock market returns, averaging around 8.0%, according to Manley.
When millennials came of investing age in 2001, the S&P 500 peaked, ushering in the dot-com bust. After stocks roared back amid a housing boom, the global financial crisis created a double top in the benchmark in 2007 that would not be eclipsed until 2013 — leaving millennial investors underwater for a dozen years.

IWM,2024-10-01,Here's how AI is set to disrupt healthcare — albeit slowly,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-how-ai-is-set-to-disrupt-healthcare--albeit-slowly-182209180.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
The third quarter just wrapped, and the pure AI trade of Nvidia (NVDA) and its chip cohorts suddenly finds itself a net drag on overall S&P 500 performance — which itself surprised investors with a solid 5.5% return.
Nevertheless, generative AI is still hot and slowly moving into real-world applications.
Abby Yoder, US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, highlighted that healthcare, which is notoriously slow-moving, may be an upcoming candidate for AI-driven innovation.
""Healthcare has underperformed seven of the last eight years,"" Yoder pointed out in a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, despite the sector being the only one in the S&P 500 to boast positive annual earnings growth over the past 21 years.
But Yoder sees AI as a potential key to unlock a long-awaited shake-up that could bring long-term growth back to the sector.
Healthcare stocks have struggled in recent years, a trend Yoder attributes to legacy constraints of old systems and obstacles that make it difficult for new technologies to take root. The byzantine web of players, rules, regulators, and more has so far prevented significant AI adoption, which has the potential to address inefficiencies in insurance approvals, manual record-keeping, and claims management, all of which drag on productivity.

There are some ripples of change, however. Companies like Google and Microsoft are diving into this space, partnering with hospitals and startups to create AI tools that lighten this burden.
On the diagnostic side, AI is being used to streamline medical imaging, cutting down time for tasks like identifying patterns in medical data, which improves both speed and accuracy in patient care. The goal is not to rid the world of human radiologists and technicians, but empower them with 21st-century tools that lighten their load and accelerate patient diagnoses and recoveries.
AI proponents say it's not just about cutting costs; it’s about revolutionizing patient care. By using vast datasets of clinical information, the promise of AI is to someday help predict patient outcomes more effectively, modeling care before it happens to anticipate complications and select treatments.
The other great hope for medical AI bulls is the immense promise for drug discovery.
According to Morgan Stanley's healthcare forecast, the company's head of US biopharma research Terence Flynn estimates that “[every] 2.5% improvement in preclinical development success rates could lead to an additional 30-plus new drug approvals over 10 years,"" which would represent around $70 billion.

IWM,2024-09-27,How to play small-cap stocks: Ollie’s and RXO,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/play-small-cap-stocks-ollie-215227750.html,"Josh Bennett, senior portfolio manager and director of research at Alger, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how to play small-cap stocks during the rate-cutting cycle.
“We think the setup is pretty good for small caps now… The fact is, as the easing cycle begins, we should see that as favorable for small caps,” Bennett says, adding, “Historically, you've seen small caps trade at about a 10% premium to the large-cap index.” He highlights that “small caps just off 20-year lows in terms of relative valuation to large-cap stocks. So valuation setup is interesting.”
The portfolio manager says that while it does look like the economy is on the way to a soft landing if we were to enter a recessionary period, there are small stocks that can weather a challenging macro. “Small is not weak. And I think that it's interesting. A lot of people think that small-cap companies don't have the strength, but when you look at where we operate in the small-cap segment, we're looking for the highest quality small-cap growth names that we can find.”

Bennett names Ollies, a closeout retailer, as a buy in the small-cap space. “They're the largest player in the closeout industry. This is an enormous industry. $300 billion in closeout, and over $200 billion of that is non-apparel, which is where Ollie's plays. So they don't compete with TJX. They don't compete with Marshall's… Why is Ollie's a buy now? Because the consumer is looking for value more than they ever have before.”
The portfolio manager also calls on RXO, a truck brokerage company that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize its network, which connects trucks with companies that need to move things. “RXO should benefit as the industrial cycle begins to pick up. They'll see that benefit.” Bennett notes that if there are supply chain disruptions from the potential port strike, RXO could gain.

IWM,2024-09-20,Great investing debate: Growth or value stocks post-rate cuts?,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/great-investing-debate-growth-value-155038127.html,"It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come.
Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis.
Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. ""What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,"" he says, ""and in many cases, that can be growth stocks."" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE).
And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. ""I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks.""

Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring ""good old fashioned names"" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth.
Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. ""It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,"" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

IWM,2024-09-05,Arnott's Debut ETF Bets on Index Rejects,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arnotts-debut-etf-bets-index-203449363.html,"Legendary investor Rob Arnott is jumping into the ETF game with a strategy of buying stocks as they are dropped from major market indexes.
Arnott, founder and chairman of Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., is the brains behind the Research Affiliates Deletions ETF (NIXT), which begins trading Sept. 10.
NIXT will track the Research Affiliates Deletions Index made up of between 140 and 180 companies that have been removed from the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 indexes over the past five years.
The index methodology, which is a relatively straight forward small-cap value play, is based on Arnott’s research showing that companies dropped from indexes because they fall below market-capitalization minimums tend to outperform the respective indexes over the next five years.
“It’s like picking up coins dropped by a rich man walking down the street,” Arnott said, citing a 7% average 12-month outperformance for dropped stocks.
That average outperformance grows to 28% when the period is extended to five years, he added.
NIXT Strategy ""Quasi Active""
Arnott, whose Research Affiliates manages $150 billion through affiliated business relationships, describes the NIXT strategy as “quasi active” even though it is tracking an index.
Based on historical patterns of companies being dropped from indexes, Arnott anticipates NIXT will see an annual turnover rate of between 20% and 40%, with each stock being held for a five-year period.
To avoid crossing over into the proprietary methodologies of the S&P and Russell indexes, Arnott said the Research Affiliates Deletions Index is not designed to perfectly replicate the two brand name indexes, but that it will track similar universes of stocks.
To reduce portfolio turnover, he explained, a 10% banding is used so that a stock has to fall out of roughly the top 550 or 1100 names before it is treated as a deletion from an index.
“Our decision in sponsoring this ETF was driven by a desire to make the index deletions strategy as accessible as possible,” Arnott said.
NIXT has an expense ratio of 39 basis points but is only charging 9 basis points for the first 12 months of trading.

Thursday marks the one-month anniversary of the Aug. 5 ""yen shock"" — a mini-market panic that quickly spread throughout global markets after beginning in Japan the Monday following the July jobs report.
The Nikkei stock index (^N225) hemorrhaged 12% that Monday — its biggest one-day drop since 1987 — while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) plummeted 3%. The VIX Volatility Index (^VIX) spiked to 65, the third-highest level on record.
But almost as soon as the selling was over that morning, the eye-popping recovery began, which could be why there's not even a compelling agreed-upon name for the event. By midday in the US on that fateful Monday, the VIX had already fallen to 30 — its biggest intraday crash on record.
By mid-August, US stocks had already erased the losses. But this roller-coaster ride of volatility highlights some critical misconceptions about the VIX. And historical price action surrounding August shocks suggests that stocks are not in the clear just yet.
The VIX has long been dubbed the “fear gauge” by financial media (including by yours truly), but this moniker oversimplifies its function. As Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, explained on a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, “[The] VIX is not a fear gauge. It plays one on TV.”
The VIX measures the market's expectation of S&P 500 volatility over the next 30 days as calculated from options on the benchmark. It doesn’t account for actual fear but rather reflects the market's best estimate of future volatility, which often coincides with market fear or panic.
According to Sosnick, “VIX is the best proxy for the demand for [institutional] hedging protection because it is really the simplest way to do a short, quick hedge on a portfolio.”
Institutional and retail investors alike can tap deep and liquid markets for VIX futures and ETFs — along with options on those instruments. (But the VIX itself is an index and does not actually trade, much like the S&P 500.)
Investors might assume that a low VIX means markets are stable and not in need of hedging. But a low VIX is an affordable VIX. ""Buy protection when you can, not when you must,"" goes the Wall Street adage. Thinking back to the Monday market meltdown with hindsight, the right play was to sell the VIX by midday — by either shorting or covering prior long bets.
The BofA data analytics team has a historical warning for investors who have already moved past last month's shock.

Since the pandemic, the ETF market has roughly doubled in size — as of the end of the first quarter, (ETFs) represented $7.1 trillion, or 13% of the US stock market and 2.8% of the US bond market, up from $3.5 trillion in 2019, according to BlackRock.
Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas Asset Management, recently stopped by Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast and highlighted some of the pros and cons of ETFs for investors.
A key advantage for ETFs is cost — the fees charged to investors have plummeted amid the race to zero commissions among the big brokers.
""You can buy an S&P 500 fund for 2 or 3 basis points. That's nothing,"" said Sohn.
To simply buy one share of each component of the S&P 500 would cost about $105,000. To replicate the entire index according to each stock's weight would cost a minimum of $15,500,000, according to Yahoo Finance calculations, which doesn't include brokerage commissions. In contrast, an annual fee of 3 basis points — or 0.03% — on an ETF means an investor would pay 30 cents for every $1,000 invested.
ETFs also tap a wide range of markets and strategies, which is essential for diversification.
Sohn highlighted that ETFs give investors ""access to virtually any market around the globe.""
In addition to geographic and asset class diversification, ETFs have evolved to mimic certain hedge fund strategies. So-called smart beta ETFs, for instance, use predetermined rules for selecting investments in a fund.
Sohn also highlighted transparency as a key benefit, as ETFs report holdings on a daily basis.
""I can look at the holdings every day. I know what ingredients are in my investment,"" said Sohn.
ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but a key distinction is intraday liquidity. ETFs can be traded throughout the day, while mutual funds can only be bought and sold on the close.
""I can trade them throughout the day if I wanted to,"" said Sohn. ""Or if I'm a large investor, I can move large amounts of money to these funds.""
Many ETFs also offer significant tax advantages, which Sohn described as their ""secret sauce.""
And during times of market stress and volatility, ETFs can act as ""shock absorbers."" If an investor is concerned about a stock's decline, Sohn explained, ""they can buy an ETF of its peers to diversify and mitigate risk.""

IWM,2024-08-28,Why gold is outperforming nearly everything so far this year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gold-is-outperforming-nearly-everything-so-far-this-year-100022695.html,"Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
Gold futures (GC=F) have been surfing record highs, with Monday's prices hitting $2,555.2 per ounce, sending the value of a 400 troy ounce gold bar to $1,022,080.
The yellow metal has forged meteoric gains this year, emerging as the world's second-best-performing asset next to crypto. Its 23% year-to-date gain edges out the megacap-loaded Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) — itself up a healthy 18%. (A proxy for the crypto market writ large, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW), is up 47% this year.)
According to BofA Global Research, gold funds just absorbed the largest inflows in four weeks, attracting $1.1 billion. Yet, the broader trend has actually seen $2.5 billion in outflows year to date, suggesting that underlying strength is coming from outside traditional fund flows.
Central banks — especially those of developing countries — have been buying the barbarous relic at a record clip. According to the World Gold Council, central banks have purchased 290 tonnes in the first quarter alone, beating out the prior Q1 record from 2023 and setting CBs on a path to record gold purchases in 2024 that are estimated to easily eclipse 1,000 tonnes.
""Not only is the long-standing trend in central bank gold buying firmly intact, it also continues to be dominated by banks from emerging markets,"" wrote the Gold Council.
In that regard, Turkey tops the buy list this year with 30 tonnes purchased in the first quarter — lifting its gold reserves to 570 tonnes. China bought 27 tonnes in Q1, making it the 17th consecutive quarter of purchases and also bringing its holdings to 2,262 tonnes. Other notable purchasers include India, Kazakhstan, the Czech Republic, Oman, and Singapore.
The central bank buying spree has solidified gold's status as a reserve asset. According to BofA, gold has now surpassed the euro to become the world's largest reserve asset second only to the US dollar, representing 16% of the reserve pool.
The precious metal’s performance can be attributed to its unique position as a real asset with one of the lowest correlations to stocks across asset classes, making it a safe haven from market swings and inflation.
According to Tom Bruni, head of market research at StockTwits, in a recent episode of Stocks in Translation, ""We're seeing gold being used as an uncertainty hedge.""
Bruni also emphasized gold's appeal to traders due to its price action. ""With gold breaking out above its 2011 highs, it's drawing significant attention from trend followers and technical analysts alike.""

Wall Street has long preached the virtues of holding bonds in a balanced investment portfolio.
This gospel says investors should steer 60% of their investments into stocks and 40% to bonds to enjoy the benefits of diversification, with uncorrelated returns helping protect investors through the market's ups and downs.
But according to Trent Smalley, a Chartered Market Technician and portfolio manager at JSPM, that advice may not be as universal as it seems — especially for younger investors.
""Young people don't need bonds unless they get extremely uncomfortable,"" Smalley said during the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast (listen below). ""Bonds are there to reduce the volatility of a portfolio. But if you're young enough, really none of that matters.""
In the 30 years from 1993 to 2023, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8%. Reinvesting dividends would have boosted that return to 9.9%, according to Yahoo Finance calculations.
Over the same 30-year period, the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index had a compounded annual growth rate of 3.3%. From its peak in late 2021 to its bottom a year later, it sunk 17.4% — a large drawdown by historical standards.

""Sometimes [the stock market's returns are] lumpy. Sometimes you get 30% a year. Sometimes, like in 2022, you're down 20%,"" said Smalley.
""If you're a young person and every two weeks you get paid by your company — if you're lucky enough you've got a 401(k) and you've got a company that will match a certain percent of that — you want the market to go down,"" Smalley added.
Bonds have also traditionally served as the go-to asset for reducing portfolio volatility and generating a steady income.
But younger investors, who have decades of earning potential ahead of them, don’t necessarily need that stability or the recurring income that comes from regular interest (or coupon) payments — a feature of bonds that many retirees depend on.
The diversification argument in favor of bonds has also been challenged in recent years.
And since 2021, stock and bond moves have been increasingly correlated, meaning they tend to both go up or down together. As the correlation between bonds and stocks increases, the diversification benefits diminish.
Bonds suffered one of their worst years on record in 2022 alongside the S&P 500's steepest annual drop since 2008. As a result, ""mom and pop"" investors in 60/40 portfolios were hit particularly hard.

Whether charting technical indicators or dissecting an earnings report, finding themes that repeat can offer investors a sense of predictability amid chaotic markets.
The most reliable patterns in finance tend to be based on the calendar year.
Seasonality, as it's called, refers to predictable and recurring changes in markets that tend to happen at the same time every year. And though markets have steadied after last week's abrupt sell-off, stock market bears looking at seasonal patterns will be encouraged by this history ahead of this year's election.
Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, recently joined Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast to break down some of these patterns for investors. Though Detrick has long been an advocate for understanding the forces of seasonality at work in the markets, he cautioned: ""We would never blindly just invest in seasonality.""
Still, investors have nearly a century of solid data from the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to analyze market trends.
For example, consumer spending usually increases during the holiday season. Back-to-school shopping boosts retail sales in late August and early September. And summer vacations or holidays can slow down overall market activity and lower trading volumes.
All of this creates observable patterns in the market that influence prices of stocks, bonds, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. This data allows returns from each day of the year to be analyzed to find the average loss or gain, and those results can be combined to create a seasonality map for the year.
The chart shows that stocks tend to go up each year, but average annual gains are interrupted by a big downturn from September into October. This data reflects the numerous market crashes that have occurred in September and October, including Black Monday in October 1987 and Black Tuesday in October 1929.
Toward the end of October, things tend to turn around, on average, and stocks often rise into year-end, capped off by the much-vaunted Santa Claus Rally.
But August is also no picnic for investors, either.
""Historically, when August is down, it tends to really be down more than any other month,"" Detrick said, citing significant events such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the Asian Contagion in 1997, and the downgrade of US debt by S&P in 2011.
As the S&P 500's seasonality map shows, not much happens in August — on average.
But we can see the effects of a pickup in volatility by studying the seasonality of the VIX (^VIX), which offers a different set of seasonal clues for investors to decipher.

The long-term bond market proxy, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), jumped 3.6% last month while the stock market benchmark, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY), had a modest gain of 1.2%.
July’s market story is not just “risk-off,” but also one of market rotation in the equity space, as small-cap funds like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) produced a massive gain of 10.3% in the month while big-tech ETFs like the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) fell 3.3%.
Why Long Term Treasury, Russell 2000 ETFs Won in July
The outperformance of both long-term Treasury ETFs and Russell 2000 ETFs in July can be attributed to changing investor expectations about interest rates and economic growth, as well as perceived high valuations for mega-cap technology companies. This led to a rotation of assets from large-cap growth stocks to safer havens and smaller, more cyclical companies.
Long-Term Treasury ETFs
Bond yields decline: The primary reason for the outperformance of long-term Treasury ETFs in July was a decline in bond yields, which have an inverse relationship with bond prices. Bonds with longer maturities (higher duration) are more rate sensitive than short-term bonds.
Fed rate expectations: Expectations of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts due to easing inflation contributed to the decline in bond yields, boosting the value of long-term Treasury bonds.
Safe-haven asset: Treasuries are often considered safe-haven assets, and during periods of market uncertainty or economic slowdown, investors tend to flock to these bonds.
Russell 2000 ETFs
Small-cap rally: The Russell 2000 index is composed of small-cap stocks, which tend to be more cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions.
Interest rate expectations: The expectation of potential interest rate cuts is generally positive for small-cap companies, as lower borrowing costs can stimulate economic growth and benefit these businesses.
Rotation from large-cap to small-cap: There was a noticeable shift in investor sentiment away from large-cap tech stocks (heavily represented in the S&P 500) and toward smaller companies.
Outlook: Long-Term Treasury, Russell 2000 ETFs
Here are potential scenarios to watch and consider for long-term Treasury ETFs and Russell 2000 ETFs in the coming months:
Long-Term Treasury ETFs
Interest rate sensitivity: The primary driver for long-term Treasury ETFs remains interest rate movements. If interest rates continue to decline, these ETFs could continue to perform well. However, if rates start to rise, their value will likely decrease.
Economic outlook: The overall economic health will also influence Treasury ETF performance. A recession could lead to increased demand for safe-haven assets like Treasuries, while a strong economy might push investors toward riskier assets.

An overarching feeling of optimism about both the economy and markets emerges from the third volume of the Yahoo Finance Chartbook, a trend similar to that seen in volume two in late January.
Across the 32 charts compiled by economists and strategists on Wall Street, we see broad confidence that the US economy can still achieve the vaunted ""soft landing"" outcome following the Fed's historic rate-hiking cycle.
Following a nearly 17% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) so far this year, equity strategists see room for the bull market to run further, as many areas of the market have only recently joined the rally.
However, just past the midpoint of 2024, there is some doubt about how long this can last without significant changes.
The risks aren't hard to find with the US presidential election looming. A stock market pullback is more than overdue, according to some market data. And a resilient economy continues to straddle the fine line between normalization from pre-pandemic trends and the start of a broader slowdown.
Economists are clamoring for changes to monetary policy to ensure the Fed can land the plane safely. Investors are also highlighting new opportunities and a potential stock market rotation as artificial intelligence enthusiasm moves into its next phase.
This volume of the Chartbook reflects markets and the economy at what Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius called an ""inflection point,"" where many things appear the same for now — but almost everything seems on the cusp of looking quite different.

David Kelly, chief global strategist, JPMorgan Asset Management Market Insights Team
""Stubborn inflation during the first quarter dashed hopes for aggressive policy easing this year. That said, inflation remains below its June 2022 peak, and disinflationary momentum has regathered steam in recent months. In fact, headline inflation rose by just 3.0% y/y in June, well below the 3.5% pace recorded just three months prior.
""While food and energy prices have been well-behaved and core goods have been a steady source of disinflation, gains in shelter and auto insurance have remained elevated, prolonging inflation’s journey back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. However, with real-time data across both categories pointing to easing price pressures, inflation should continue its slow descent and return to 2% by the middle of next year. If, as expected, inflationary pressures ease through the summer, the Federal Reserve should feel comfortable cutting rates twice this year, delivering a first cut in September.""

IWM,2024-07-18,Small-cap debate continues as rally in Russell 2000 stalls,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-cap-debate-continues-as-rally-in-russell-2000-stalls-194527842.html,"One of Wall Street's favorite calls to start 2024 has finally been leading the stock market rally.
After significantly underperforming the broader market for the first six months of the year, small caps have soared over the past week. The historic rally followed a better-than-expected June inflation reading that has markets increasingly optimistic about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
In the past month, the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index has gained about 8%, far outpacing the S&P 500's less than 1% in the same period. On Thursday, however, the move showed some signs of stalling out. The Russell 2000 dropped more than 2%, extending losses from Wednesday's trading session.
And the pressing question among Wall Street strategists right now is whether the rally has more room to run.

""We think there is room for the rotation into low quality to persist if rate cuts remain priced and the Trump 2.0 trade carries on ahead of US elections,"" UBS Investment Bank US equity derivatives strategist Maxwell Grinacoff wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.
Grinacoff added that the keys to the rally continuing include further cooling in inflation and economic data showing similar, or higher, levels of growth.
From the day of the latest inflation print on July 11 through July 16, the rally in small caps was historic.
As investors moved to price in a 100% chance of an interest rate cut from the Fed in September, the Russell 2000 rose than 11% in five trading days, including a more than 3% bounce on Tuesday alone. This marked the largest outperformance from the S&P 500 in five-day period on record, per Bespoke Investment Group.
DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas noted this historic action signals ""investor sentiment has shifted dramatically and the move very likely has further to run.""

On Wednesday, Bank of America's head of US equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian told Yahoo Finance the trend in small caps is ""likely to persist.""
But to Subramanian that doesn't mean simply buying the Russell 2000 index is the right trade.
Subramanian highlighted about one-third of the Russell 2000 isn't profitable, and overall the index faces far more refinancing risks amid higher interest rates than an index like the S&P 500.
""Their valuations are at levels that would warrant a pretty equitable comeback,"" Subramanian said.
Still, Subramanian isn't overly confident in the index as a whole, noting that areas that have more refinancing risk or credit sensitivity are ""potentially still in the penalty box until the Fed actually begins to cut rates.""

IWM,2024-07-17,Small caps have 'incredible tailwind' coming: Portfolio manager,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/small-caps-incredible-tailwind-coming-212631382.html,"Small cap stocks (^RUT) have seen a resurgence in recent sessions as investors seem to begin to rotate out of Big Tech.
Villere & Co. portfolio manager Sandy Villere joins Market Domination to talk about how investors can play small cap stocks as the market begins to rotate out of the tech trade.
Villere comments on the outlook for small caps:
""I mean we're expecting robust earnings growth, right, and even when rates go down right, even if you're looking at 14.5 times earnings. Remember when rates go down and there's a lot of leverage that small caps use, so I think the earnings are actually going to be even better than what are currently modeled into those forecasts. So I think small caps have an incredible tailwind behind them. And a great opportunity to get involved again.""
He goes on to weigh in on several small-cap stocks On Holding (ONON), First Hawaiian (FHB), and Option Care Health (OPCH).

IWM,2024-07-17,It's not 'too late' to invest in small caps: Strategist,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/not-too-invest-small-caps-152259921.html,"The Russell 2000 (^RUT) has risen by more than 10% in the last five trading sessions, marking the longest streak of gains for the small-cap index since April 2020. MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Chris Grisanti joins Catalysts to discuss the growth of small caps and how investors should position their portfolios.
Grisanti believes that small caps are still ""underpriced,"" despite having the Russell 2000 having ""its biggest move in terms of standard deviations that we've seen in more than 30 years over the last week."" He calls the rally a ""convincing reversal"" and believes that its growth does not rely on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.
""It would scare me if the Fed cut rates... the Fed cuts rates not to give you a break, but because bad things are starting to happen. The economy is starting to slow, earnings are starting to get lower. So if the Fed cuts, they're seeing something that's scaring them.""
He adds that small-cap stocks are cheap buying opportunities: ""I don't think it's too late to initiate positions if you haven't already.""

IWM,2024-07-15,"Investors Bought Up IWM, RSP Last Week",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-bought-iwm-rsp-last-211949252.html,"A cool $36 billion flowed into U.S.-listed ETFs during the week ending Friday, July 12, pushing year-to-date inflows above $406 billion.

U.S. equity ETFs pulled in the bulk of the weekly inflows as stocks continued to hit record highs, but fixed income ETFs also saw demand as rate cut expectations ticked higher following the latest inflation data.

The S&P 500 was up by almost 19% on a year-to-date basis on Friday. Investors cheered data which showed a smaller-than-expected increase in consumer prices last month.

The probability of a rate cut in September neared 90% after the CPI data came out, which also lent support to bond prices.

Individual flows winners for last week include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).

Small caps handily outperformed their large cap counterparts last week as investors rotated into cheaper stocks from the megacap stocks that have led this year’s rally.

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) was also in high demand with weekly inflows of $1 billion. The daily return differential between RSP and SPY on Thursday—the day the CPI data came out—was the largest since 2020.

Still, despite there being some rotation from megacaps to smaller stocks, the tech giants that dominate the S&P 500 remain close to their all-time highs. 

In other words, everything seems to be working all of a sudden—mega caps, small caps and everything in between.

Only one ETF saw outflows of more than $1 billion last week: the Invesco Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor ETF (OMFL). 

The Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 2X Shares (SOXL) and the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) followed suit with outflows of $663 million and $446 million, respectively, on what seems to be profit taking after huge rallies.

The two ETFs are up 106% and 62%, respectively, so far this year.

IWM,2024-07-09,Does SPY and Its 18% Rise Reflect U.S. Markets?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-spy-18-rise-reflect-205114548.html,"Depending upon which ETF you look at, the U.S. stock market’s performance so far this year has been tepid, fantastic or more likely, somewhere in between.
The world’s largest exchange-traded fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has broken record highs on its way to gaining 18% this year, just past the year's midway point.

Seen through a different lens, the market’s performance looks much less impressive. The narrower SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) is up just 5.1% year-to-date. DIA’s return is similar to 4.7% gain for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), while it’s far superior to the mere 0.9% return for the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM).

The wide-ranging returns for various U.S. stock market ETFs is a reflection of the current environment which has favored megacap tech companies above all else. 

One stock alone—Nvidia—has boosted SPY’s return by almost 500 basis points, while high interest rates have weighed on the profitability of many of the smaller companies that make up IWM.

Of course, IWM is hardly reflective of the overall U.S. stock market. The combined market cap of the Russell 2000 index is $2.8 trillion, less than Nvidia on its own.

But the Dow Jones, as imperfect as it is, has historically been a decent indicator of how the stock market is faring. And maybe it still is.

DIA’s return matches that of RSP, an ETF which tracks a version of the S&P 500 where every holding is equally weighted. It puts much less emphasis on the giant companies that dominate the traditional S&P 500.

The gap between SPY and RSP is currently around 1,300 basis points, which would be the second-largest performance differential for the ETFs since RSP’s inception in 2003 (in 2009, RSP soared almost 45%, trouncing the 26% gain for SPY).

Which ETF is more indicative of the performance of the U.S. stock market is open for debate. While the traditional S&P 500 tracked by SPY is the most widely-followed index of U.S. stocks, if the index continues to outperform its equal-weighted counterpart by leaps and bounds due to the incredible performance of a handful of stocks, an increasing number of investors may question whether it truly represents the stock market at large.

One firm that has been investing in OpenAI is Ark Invest.
Cathie Wood, ARK Invest's CEO and CIO, is betting big on AI. She says OpenAI, along with Anthropic, xAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) are ""stealing the march"" in the space.
While many investors are concerned about when companies will start seeing returns on their AI investments, Wood is hopeful. When asked about when OpenAI will start to turn a profit, she points to the development of agentic AI, which she thinks will open the door to more profitability, given that companies will be able to charge more for it.
Despite some recent executive departures at OpenAI, Wood is confident in the startup's leadership, praising both CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. She notes that ""what we witness in companies that are growing very quickly from startup into scaling is you need a different kind of management team.""

When it comes to competition between AI firms, Wood likes it. ""Competition is good. It's going to make this space more competitive and more effective, I think, longer term,"" she says.
On the possibility of a company like OpenAI going public, Wood argues ""a lot of companies are staying private longer. They just don't want to deal with the regulation in the public equity markets. And they also don't want to deal with the very short-term oriented or short-term investment time horizon of shareholders in the public equity markets."" However, she does think the public market could become more appealing with interest rates coming down and if investors were willing to stomach the longer-term time horizons some of these companies are working with.

LIT,2024-10-04,Albemarle Stock Surge Despite Uncertainty of Rio Tinto's Lithium Acquisitions,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/albemarle-stock-surge-despite-uncertainty-153320977.html,"October 4, 2024 - Rises on news that Rio Tinto Plc (NYSE:RIO) is considering lithium acquisitions, as reported by The Australian despite no guarantee of successful acquisition.
The Australian report suggests that Rio Tinto Plc is considering Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) and Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), two major players in lithium market, as potential targets. But it's important to note that negotiations are ongoing, and there is no guarantee of a successful acquisition.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ALB.
The interest in acquiring major players in the lithium space aligns with the growing demand for lithium batteries, primarily driven by the growing demand of electric vehicles and meeting the company's sustainability goals. The acquisition, which is not yet exercised, has caused Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock to rise 5% upon the market opening on October 5, 2024.
For information, Albemarle Corporation is a leading global producer of lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, and is also a major player in the production of catalysts used in refining and petrochemical processes. While Arcadium Lithium is a Canadian exploration and development company focused on lithium projects in North America.
To add a new revenue stream for Rio Tinto, beyond its traditional mining commodities, by integrating a new acquisition of lithium producers to Tinto's portfolio could be complex, requiring careful planning and execution.
Recent Stock Performance and Trends to Consider:
Volatility: ALB stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, primarily driven by fluctuations in lithium prices.
Lithium Demand: The growing demand for lithium batteries, driven by the electric vehicle market, has been a key factor influencing ALB's stock performance.
Supply and Demand Dynamics: Changes in lithium supply and demand dynamics, including new production capacity and geopolitical factors, can also impact ALB's stock price.
Technological Advancements: Advances in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries, could potentially impact the demand for lithium and, consequently, ALB's business.
And also there are significant revenue increases experienced by Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) in 2022 and 2023.
Albemarle Stock Surge Despite Uncertainty of Rio Tinto's Lithium Acquisitions
The significant revenue increases were attributed to several factors such as the Booming Lithium Market by the rapid expansion of the electric vehicle growth causing Albermarle to expand its lithium production capacity to meet the growing demand and therefore contributing to higher revenues. Increased production and the rising lithium prices make increased revenue.

LIT,2024-10-04,5 Top Stocks to Buy in October,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stocks-buy-october-104500040.html,"With the first three quarters of the calendar year in the books, investors are strolling into October with the major indexes at all-time highs and a more than 20% year-to-date gain in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Go back even further, and the S&P 500 is up a staggering 50% since the start of 2023.
Efficiency improvements and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered innovations are sending ripple effects through the stock market -- from changing how legacy companies do business to setting the stage for more demand for energy and electricity to power data centers.
The Federal Reserve just announced its first interest rate cut in four years, which was quickly followed by a Chinese stimulus package and rate cuts. With the cost of capital getting cheaper, there's reason to believe consumer spending could get a much-needed uptick this fall.
Despite all the momentum heading into October, investors should still take a long-term approach. They should only invest in companies that they believe can deliver on promises and navigate the cycle, and that are worth holding for at least three to five years. Here's why five Fool.com contributors picked Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) as top stocks to buy in October.

It's time to pounce on affordable Berkshire shares
Anders Bylund (Berkshire Hathaway): It's rarely a bad time to invest in Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett's insurance-based investing machine almost always looks ready to beat the stock market in the long run.
But you know what Buffett says about pricing. He prefers buying stock in amazing companies at a fair price. That's his secret recipe for keeping business risks low and investor returns high. That wisdom-packed quote applies perfectly to Berkshire's own stock right now.
The company is not putting much money in the market these days. Berkshire's cash and short-term investment reserves have swelled to $277 billion, crushing the former record of $150 billion in the fall of 2021. More than 21% of Berkshire's assets are held in the form of cash or liquid government bonds. That's not exactly a record, but it's the highest ratio seen since the aftermath of the dot-com bubble popping.
That's exciting to me. I can't wait to see what the investing legend will invest in when the time is right. But Berkshire's market makers have a different view, driving the stock 3% lower in September. Whether you're buying the high-priced Class A shares or the more affordable Class B stock, Berkshire trades at just 14.6 times trailing earnings today.

LIT,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

LIT,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

LIT,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""

Todd Rosenbluth, TMX VettaFi Head of Research, joins Wealth! to discuss how you can play the China trade without cashing in on specific names.
""For much of the year, China has underperformed the broader emerging markets. And so investors actually have been gravitating towards these ex-china ETFs... but this China stimulus that we're talking about could be the necessary boost to get more investors focusing on China,"" Rosenbluth tells Yahoo Finance.
He points to ETFs like GXC (GXC) as a broad market exposure ETF, and highlights China A-Shares (ASHR) as an opportunity to get broader exposure to the Chinese stock market. In addition, he notes that KWEB (KWEB) is a great way for investors to get exposed to some well-known names and faster-growing companies in China.
Watch the video above to hear some of Rosenbluth's ETF plays for the port strike affecting the US's East and Gulf Coasts.

LIT,2024-10-02,How to protect your investments in unstable markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/protect-investments-markets-tensions-middle-east-war-131621278.html,"Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.
Traders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.
As tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.
Investors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran ""will pay for it"".
Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.

“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.
“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”
Regardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.
""It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,"" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.
Economists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.
How to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks
The magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.
Core sectors for geopolitical resilience
Artificial intelligence and semiconductors
The race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:
Stocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

LIT,2024-10-01,Jobs Report to Test Stock Bull and Fixed Income ETFs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-test-stock-bull-120000661.html,"With the recent Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) in the rear-view mirror, the next big test for stocks’ all-time highs and fixed income ETFs is Friday’s jobs report.
Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated that price increases are easing towards the Fed's 2% target. That’s shifting more attention to the central bank's other key goal: maintaining maximum employment.
Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the labor market remains in ""solid shape"" and pointed out that the Fed is reducing interest rates partially to sustain that strength. However, signs the labor market is slowing have emerged.
Unemployment has steadily risen throughout 2024, and it now stands at 4.2%, its highest point in nearly three years. Job creation has also weakened, with two of the smallest monthly job gains recorded this year, and job openings in July hit their lowest since January 2021.
As this week’s key jobs report approaches, the primary concern is the pace at which the labor market slows.
The monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report jobs report will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday.
Why Investors Will Be Watching Friday’s Jobs Report
Investors will closely watch Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report because it provides crucial insights into the labor market, which directly influences Federal Reserve policy. The report includes data on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth, which are key indicators of economic health.
If the labor market shows stronger-than-expected growth, that may cast doubt on the size and frequency of coming rate cuts, as the Fed aims to prevent the economy from overheating. Conversely, weaker-than-expected job numbers may prompt the Fed to consider further or deeper cuts, potentially boosting markets, especially bond prices.
In addition, wage growth data is significant because higher wages can fuel inflation by increasing consumer spending, causing additional concern that inflation may remain sticker than expected.
Jobs Report Outlook for Stock and Fixed Income ETFs
The stock and bond markets may react differently to Friday’s jobs report based on whether the unemployment rate comes in higher or lower than expected.
If unemployment comes in higher than expected: This would signal a weakening labor market, potentially indicating an economic slowdown. For stocks, especially cyclical or growth-oriented sector ETFs like the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), respectively, this could trigger a negative reaction as concerns about reduced consumer spending and economic activity grow. However, rate-sensitive ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) may react positively since a softer labor market could lead the Federal Reserve to pause or cut interest rates sooner, lowering yields and boosting bond prices.
If unemployment comes in lower than expected: A stronger-than-expected labor market suggests robust economic growth, which would bolster investor confidence in equities, especially in sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials. However, bond prices might fall as investors anticipate that the Fed could maintain or raise rates to manage inflation, driving yields higher.

LIT,2024-10-01,"Chinese Stocks Are Soaring, but So Are These 3 Dividend Stocks That Are Up Between 5% and 16% in 3 Days",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-stocks-soaring-3-dividend-083000538.html,"China just released a stimulus package to help the country reach its 5% economic growth target for 2024 and jolt its struggling housing and equity markets. The announcement came after the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled a 50-basis-point (0.5%) rate cut to counter rising unemployment and help consumers who have been hit hard by inflation and soaring housing costs.
The stimulus package led to a surge in Chinese stock prices and U.S.-based companies exposed to China. Here's why Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), and Estee Lauder (NYSE: EL) surged between 5% and 16% from Sept. 24 to Sept. 26, and whether these dividend stocks are worth buying now.
Image source: Getty Images.
A global bellwether across energy and industrials
Caterpillar hit a new intraday all-time high on Sept. 26 and is now up more than 40% year to date. The stock has been roaring higher in response to U.S. rate cuts and, now, the China stimulus package.
Caterpillar is known for its construction machinery business. But in 2023, its energy and transportation segment produced more revenue than construction. The segment includes oil and gas, power generation, industrial applications, and transportation. Resource industries, which are mainly focused on mining, earned nearly half as much revenue as construction.
Caterpillar is also highly diversified geographically. Fifty-four percent of 2023 sales came from outside the U.S. The Asia-Pacific region (led by China) contributed $11.73 billion in 2023 sales -- or 17.5% of total sales. Caterpillar's mining business, in particular, is enormous in China.
China's stimulus is excellent news for Caterpillar, which has seen weakness across its Asia/Pacific business. If Caterpillar can sustain its momentum, the stock could remain a good value. In the following chart, you can see that Caterpillar's stock price has been soaring in lockstep with earnings growth.
CAT Chart
However, analyst average estimates had called for just $22.12 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $22.87 in 2025,  implying slowing growth.
Since Caterpillar is a cyclical company, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio tends to be low during expansion periods and high during downturns. So while its 17.8 P/E doesn't look too pricey at first glance, it is buoyed by abnormally high trailing earnings. The valuation could begin to look much more expensive if growth slows.
Buying Caterpillar now is a bet that the U.S. and China's interest rate cuts will spur economic growth and help both countries avoid recessions. Even if Caterpillar sells off, investors can take solace in its dividend, which which at 1.4% isn't stellar, but the company has increased it for 30 consecutive years.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened slightly lower on the last trading day of the third quarter. While September is a historically weak month for stocks, markets are on track for one of the strongest in over a decade as they rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut.
Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president Dana D’Auria notes that while inflation continues to cool, all eyes have now turned to the state of the labor market. D’Auria stresses the importance of the upcoming September jobs data, explaining that employment data will be the ""single biggest factor"" weighed by the Fed ahead of its next interest rate decision. She argues that the market has been ""overshooting on expectations of the Fed pretty substantially and pretty regularly."" With some investors are pricing in another 50-basis-point cut in November, she pushes back, saying, ""I wouldn't expect more than another 25-25 this year.""

It's not too late to play the China stimulus rally: Strategist

As markets enter the fourth quarter, growth is visibly expanding beyond the tech sector. Charles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist Kevin Gordon explains that there isn't a ""definitive leadership shift"" from tech to defensive sectors. Instead, he observes that utilities (XLU) and related sectors are playing ""catch-up"" following the AI-driven tech boom. Notably, sectors like industrials (XLI), financials (XLF), and materials (XLB) are outperforming as cyclical parts of the market fare ""relatively well."" Gordon characterizes this as a broadening of the market rather than a clear-cut leadership change.
Ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are bracing for a strike at midnight, as the International Longshoremen's Union is demanding higher pay and protection from automation for its port workers. Margaret Kidd, University of Houston instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology, tells Yahoo Finance that some estimates project that a port strike could cost the US $5 billion per day. She notes that the last port strike was in 1977 and lasted for 45 days. Back then, trade only made up 16% of the US economy. Today, that figure is 28%; therefore, a port strike would be a ""huge hit on the economy,"" Kidd explains.
Meanwhile, the Boeing (BA) factory worker strike heads into its third week, with the union reporting talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike.

LIT,2024-09-30,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs of Q3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-heavily-traded-etfs-160000314.html,"The ETF industry saw explosive growth in the third quarter, piling up huge assets amid the stock market surge. This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world, with most funds trading at extremely high volumes. Volume can be determined by the number of shares traded in a particular period. High trading volume indicates high liquidity, which is a key characteristic of ETFs.

Here's why volume is relevant:

Liquidity: High-volume ETFs are more liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold easily without causing a significant price change. This is important for investors as it allows them to enter or exit positions without impacting the price too much.

Bid-Ask Spread: High-volume ETFs typically have narrower bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. A narrower spread means lower transaction costs for investors.

Price Discovery: High trading volumes can lead to better price discovery, which means the market price of the ETF more accurately reflects its underlying value. This is because, with more trades, there's a higher likelihood that the ETF price will reflect the collective knowledge and sentiment of a larger pool of investors.

Market Impact: If an ETF has a low trading volume, large trades can significantly impact its price. This is less of a concern with high-volume ETFs (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of the Third Quarter).

Lower Tracking Error: High trading volumes might help in better tracking of the underlying index, leading to a lower tracking error, especially for index ETFs. This is because the arbitrage mechanism works efficiently when the ETF is actively traded.

Indication of Interest: High trading volume can also be an indication of high interest in a particular market or sector. For example, if an ETF that tracks a specific industry has a high trading volume, it could indicate that many investors are interested in that industry.

Volatility: ETFs with low trading volumes can sometimes be more volatile than those with high volumes. This is because a small number of trades can have a larger impact on the price of the ETF.

That said, we have highlighted 10 ETFs that have seen higher average volumes in the third quarter and are thus the top 10 funds in terms of trading volume, per etfdb.com (see: all the Category ETFs here).

ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) – Average Daily Volume: 169.7 million shares

LIT,2024-09-30,Top and Flop ETFs of the First Nine Months,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-flop-etfs-first-nine-141700023.html,"Wall Street has shown a remarkable rally with the three major indices on track to wrap up the first nine months of 2024 near record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks that weighed on investors’ confidence. 

The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 20.3%, 12.3% and 20.7%, respectively, so far this year (read: 5 ETFs Up More Than 35% in the First Nine Months). 

After holding the rates at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.

The central bank projects two more rate cuts of 50 bps in its final two meetings this year, due in November and December. It also indicates another 100-bps rate cut next year and a 50-bps cut in 2026, which means four rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Lower interest rates will lead to reduced borrowing costs, helping businesses to expand operations easily and resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, will stimulate economic growth and provide a boost to the stock market.

Some interesting facts from the first nine months:

U.S. stocks achieved multiple records with the tech-heavy Nasdaq being the outperformer in the first half and the Dow Jones in the third quarter. The shift in sentiments from the technology to the cyclical sectors came on rate cuts optimism. 

The utility sector has gained immense investor attraction in recent months as a new emerging AI play, especially after the technology lost momentum on overvaluation concerns. This is especially true as AI is bolstering the demand for electricity, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. Utility is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rate cut as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields. Further, the stock market volatility has raised the appeal for utility stocks as a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin regained momentum lately spurred by expectations of a reduction in borrowing costs by the Fed, which led to greater demand for speculative assets. The world's largest cryptocurrency enjoyed an incredible run in the first quarter amid the launch of new spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism about the tokens but cooled down in the second quarter (read: Fed Rate Cuts Raise Appeal for Bitcoin ETFs). 

On the commodity side, precious metals like gold and silver and base metals like copper performed well during the first nine months. Rate cut bets and geopolitical tension drive up the price for both the precious metals, which are considered a store of wealth for investors. Copper prices rallied on bullish long-term trends and tight supply conditions amid a rush to build data centers and the continued electrification of the global economy.

We have highlighted three ETFs each from the best and worst-performing zones in the first nine months of 2024.

LIT,2024-09-30,Should You Invest in the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-invesco-kbw-high-dividend-102006954.html,"Looking for broad exposure to the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (KBWD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2010.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 4, placing it in top 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $391.35 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market. KBWD seeks to match the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses.
The KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index is a dividend yield weighted index seeking to reflect the performance of approximately 24 to 40 publicly listed financial companies engaged in the business of providing financial services and products, including banking, insurance and diversified financial services, in the US.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 2.02%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 11.95%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Agnc Investment Corp (AGNC) accounts for about 3.89% of total assets, followed by Armour Residential Reit Inc (ARR) and Two Harbors Investment Corp (TWO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 35.83% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4.65% and it's up approximately 13.51% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/30/2024), respectively. KBWD has traded between $13.12 and $16.26 during this last 52-week period.

LIT,2024-09-27,SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smh-vs-ftxl-semiconductor-etf-220811826.html,"After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU) post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.
Micron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.
Let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.
Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 
SMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.
The $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.
SMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
As readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.
The strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.
Is SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.

AAPU,2024-06-05,Direxion META Single-Stock ETFs Wrap Mag-7 Lineup,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/direxion-meta-single-stock-etfs-205126659.html,"Direxion, which manages more than $40.1 billion in 85 ETFs, launched a pair of funds that offer leveraged long and short exposure to Meta Platforms Inc., filling out its Magnificent Seven single-stock lineup.
The Direxion Daily META Bull 2X Shares ETF (METU) and the Direxion META Bear 1X Shares ETF (METD) complete Direxion’s Mag Seven single-stock ETF lineup that was initiated in August 2022 with exchange-traded funds offering levered and short exposure to Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. New York-based Direxion added single-stock ETF exposure to Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.  in September 2022 and Nvidia Corp. a year later.
The deliberate pace of the rollout, which began shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission started allowing single-stock ETFs, was pegged to anticipated investor appetite, according to Ed Egilinsky, managing director at New York-based Direxion.
“We wanted to see how the single-stock ETFs would be received, and we thought some of the other single stocks might be more readily traded,” he said.
Direxion's Full Slate of Mag Seven ETFs
Because the single-stock ETFs make long or short bets and the price resets daily, share price volatility is an important factor for attracting active investors and day traders.
“Single-stock ETFs have exploded in popularity recently,” said etf.com Senior ETF Analyst Sumit Roy, who cited the success of the GraniteShares 2X Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which has grown to $3 billion.
Another example of appeal in the category is the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares ETF (TSLL) at $1 billion.
“These are numbers that a lot of people wouldn't have believed when single-stock ETFs launched less than two years ago,” Roy added.
The leverage on six Mag Seven single-stock ETFs that Direxion launched prior to the META versions were each changed from 1.5 times leverage to 2 times leverage in April to reach the maximum allowed leverage for single-stock ETFs.
Across Direxion’s ETF lineup, Egilinsky said three of the top 10 funds in terms of inflows this year are single-stock ETFs.
As trading vehicles, the levered and inverse ETFs can see wild moves in terms of inflows and outflows, Egilinsky said.
“With the market rallying we’ve seen some top inflows in our bear products,” he said.

AAPU,2024-05-03,"Apple ETFs Jump on Earnings, $110B Buyback",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-etfs-jump-earnings-110-202414482.html,"Exchange-traded funds holding Apple Inc. moved higher Friday after the iPhone maker reported first quarter results that exceeded expectations and announced a $110 billion share buyback.
Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple jumped around 7%. Apple reported it earned $1.53 per share, beating the estimate of $1.51, while revenues of $90.8 billion beat the $90.4 billion expectation.
The stock was also supported by the company's announcement that it would buy back an additional $110 billion worth of shares. That was more than the $90 billion in buybacks the company had announced in recent years.
Revenues for Apple have fallen year-over-year in five of the past six quarters, but investors were assuaged by comments from Apple that indicated growth in the low single digits for Q2.
Apple is held by 458 exchange-traded funds, including big weightings in many tech ETFs like the $63 billion Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and the $62 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which allocate over a fifth of their portfolios to the stock. The stock also has a hefty 8.5% weighting in the popular $250 billion Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). All of those funds rose today.
For aggressive traders who want more concentrated exposure to Apple, the $60 million Direxion Daily AAPL Bull 2X Shares (AAPU) offers just that. That fund jumped 13% midday Friday, twice the gain for shares of Apple.
Low Expectations
Expectations were low for Apple ahead of the release of its first quarter earnings report. The stock was down by 10% since the start of the year, sharply lagging the S&P 500’s 6.2% return.
After today’s jump, Apple’s losses have been cut to 4%.
Industry channel checks had suggested that the iPhone had lost significant market share in China.
But even though Apple’s China revenue dropped 8% from a year ago in Q1, the company attributed it to a drop in sales of other products—not the iPhone.
Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that iPhone revenues in China actually increased, which was a relief for investors.

AMZU,2024-10-04,Is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-equal-weight-102008178.html,"The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF (RSPF) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Financials ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Managed by Invesco, RSPF has amassed assets over $277.95 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX before fees and expenses.
The S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&P 500 Index.
Cost & Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
RSPF's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Globe Life Inc (GL) accounts for about 1.67% of total assets, followed by Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) and Corpay Inc (CPAY).
RSPF's top 10 holdings account for about 15.56% of its total assets under management.

AMZU,2024-10-03,American Century Debuting European ETFs With Avantis,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-century-debuting-european-etfs-120000871.html,"American Century has made its European debut with two active ETFs capturing global equities and small caps.
The Avantis Global Equity UCITS ETF (AVWC) and Avantis Global Small Cap Value UCITS ETF (AVWS) listed on the Deutsche Boerse today with total expense ratios (TERs) of 0.22% and 0.39%, respectively.
AVWC will actively select large, mid and small-cap securities from developed markets and seek to outperform by overweighting securities the manager identifies as trading at lower valuations and with higher profitability ratios. The ETF is benchmarked against the MSCI World IMI index.
AVWS employs the same selection criteria but with a specific focus on smaller companies and is benchmarked against the MSCI World Small Cap Value index.
American Century, known in the U.S. as a mutual fund company, manages $3.38 billion in 19 exchange-traded funds.
Tapping the low tracking error style of active management style which has gained traction so far within European ETFs, American Century’s maiden offerings will seek to minimize turnover and unnecessary risks while maximizing diversification.
The firm also registered the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity UCITS ETF with the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) but has yet to launch the strategy.
American Century Debuts With Avantis
The ETFs have been introduced by Avantis Investors, the firm’s quantitative investment unit, led by CIO Eduardo Repetto.
Repetto commented: “We have been asked for a long time now when we will have offerings available outside the United States, so this is a great day.
“Many investors have found value in our approach to building portfolios, and we are happy to bring our low-cost, well-diversified strategies to the European marketplace.”
Richard Adams, head of EMEA for American Century Investments, added: “Avantis Investors offers core building blocks for an investor’s allocation.
“More and more, the clients and prospects we speak with are interested in Avantis, so we are thrilled to have these available for clients to access.”
The move sees American Century become just the latest U.S. asset manager to enter Europe after Janus Henderson acquired fixed income specialist Tabula Investment Management in April and Pacer ETFs debuted three ETFs a month later.
Avantis Investors currently boasts $54 billion in assets under management (AUM) across 28 products in the U.S. in little over five years since coming to market.

AMZU,2024-10-03,Unsure Which AI Stock to Buy? Check Out This ETF That Has Crushed the Market This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unsure-ai-stock-buy-check-115800576.html,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be difficult. It's clear that this technology will significantly affect the world, but picking which company to invest in can be tricky. Instead of picking one or two stocks, purchasing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on the sector is an alternative. ETFs trade just like stocks but consist of multiple companies, spreading out the risk.
One ETF that specializes in companies primed to benefit from AI is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH). This fund holds many companies leading the way in AI products and has plenty of room to continue rising.
The ETF holds some top-tier AI investments
ETFs are required to disclose what stocks are in their fund, so it's easy to see what you're actually investing in. Here are the top 10 holdings for the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and their current weighting.
Company
Weighting
Nvidia
19.57%
Taiwan Semiconductor
12.22%
Broadcom
7.81%
AMD
5.17%
ASML
4.95%
Applied Materials
4.67%
Texas Instruments
4.38%
Qualcomm
4.33%
Micron Technology
4.21%
Analog Devices
4.07%
Data source: VanEck. Makeup is as of 9/30/2024.
Clearly, this ETF is weighted heavily toward some AI heavy hitters in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. These two make up about a third of the fund, which I think is a great strategy.
Nvidia's GPUs are powering the AI arms race by developing AI models and running them after they have been trained. Taiwan Semiconductor is a key chip fabricator that makes chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and many other big-tech companies.
By investing heavily in Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, you're not trying to pick a winner in AI; you're just benefiting from the companies that are selling the tools to compete. This is known as picks-and-shovels investing -- from the days when folks made their fortune supplying prospectors. This is the same idea behind the VanEck ETF: It wins no matter what company ultimately strikes gold in AI.
The fund has already had a tremendous year, rising over 40% so far, outperforming the market's return of 21.5% (as measured by the S&P 500). But can it keep it up?
2025 should be another strong year for this ETF
The big question surrounding AI investing is how long it will take to build out the computing power necessary to train these models to deliver what clients want.
One of the biggest spenders in the AI arms race has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that AI will take years to pay off because it must continue building out infrastructure to compete. Meta also warned investors in its outlook that "" ... infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.""
